          "title": "The Boy Who Lived",
          "content": "<p> Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you&#39;d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn&#39;t hold with such nonsense.<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.<br /> <br /> The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn&#39;t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley&#39;s sister, but they hadn&#39;t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn&#39;t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn&#39;t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.<br /> <br /> When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.<br /> <br /> None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.<br /> <br /> At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls.<br /> <br /> &quot;Little tyke,&quot; chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four&#39;s drive.<br /> <br /> It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn&#39;t realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn&#39;t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn&#39;t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.<br /> <br /> But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn&#39;t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn&#39;t bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren&#39;t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn&#39;t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn&#39;t see the owls swooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he&#39;d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.<br /> <br /> He&#39;d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker&#39;s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn&#39;t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn&#39;t see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Potters, that&#39;s right, that&#39;s what I heard--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;-- yes, their son, Harry--&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.<br /> <br /> He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn&#39;t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn&#39;t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He&#39;d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn&#39;t blame her -- if he&#39;d had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...<br /> <br /> He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o&#39;clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn&#39;t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, &quot;Don&#39;t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!&quot;<br /> <br /> And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn&#39;t approve of imagination.<br /> <br /> As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn&#39;t improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he&#39;d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shoo!&quot; said Mr. Dursley loudly.<br /> <br /> The cat didn&#39;t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door&#39;s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (&quot;Won&#39;t!&quot;). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:<br /> <br /> &quot;And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation&#39;s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.&quot; The newscaster allowed himself a grin. &quot;Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, Ted,&quot; said the weatherman, &quot;I don&#39;t know about that, but it&#39;s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they&#39;ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it&#39;s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...<br /> <br /> Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He&#39;d have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. &quot;Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven&#39;t heard from your sister lately, have you?&quot;<br /> <br /> As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn&#39;t have a sister.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; she said sharply. &quot;Why?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Funny stuff on the news,&quot; Mr. Dursley mumbled. &quot;Owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So?&quot; snapped Mrs. Dursley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he&#39;d heard the name &quot;Potter.&quot; He decided he didn&#39;t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, &quot;Their son -- he&#39;d be about Dudley&#39;s age now, wouldn&#39;t he?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I suppose so,&quot; said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s his name again? Howard, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. &quot;Yes, I quite agree.&quot;<br /> <br /> He didn&#39;t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.<br /> <br /> Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn&#39;t think he could bear it.<br /> <br /> The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind... He couldn&#39;t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn&#39;t affect them...<br /> <br /> How very wrong he was.<br /> <br /> Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn&#39;t so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.<br /> <br /> A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you&#39;d have thought he&#39;d just popped out of the ground. The cat&#39;s tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.<br /> <br /> Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man&#39;s name was Albus Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> Albus Dumbledore didn&#39;t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, &quot;I should have known.&quot;<br /> <br /> He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. He clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn&#39;t be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn&#39;t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.&quot;<br /> <br /> He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.<br /> <br /> &quot;How did you know it was me?&quot; she asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear Professor, I&#39;ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d be stiff if you&#39;d been sitting on a brick wall all day,&quot; said Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;ve celebrating, all right,&quot; she said impatiently. &quot;You&#39;d think they&#39;d be a bit more careful, but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something&#39;s going on. It was on their news.&quot; She jerked her head back at the Dursleys&#39; dark living-room window. &quot;I heard it. Flocks of owls... shooting stars... Well, they&#39;re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent -- I&#39;ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You can&#39;t blame them,&quot; said Dumbledore gently. &quot;We&#39;ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know that,&quot; said Professor McGonagall irritably. &quot;But that&#39;s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.&quot;<br /> <br /> She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn&#39;t, so she went on. &quot;A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It certainly seems so,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A what?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A lemon drop. They&#39;re a kind of Muggle sweet I&#39;m rather fond of.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, thank you,&quot; said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn&#39;t think this was the moment for lemon drops. &quot;As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this &#39;You-Know-Who&#39; nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.&quot; Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. &quot;It all gets so confusing if we keep saying &#39;You-Know-Who.&#39; I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort&#39;s name.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know you haven&#39;t, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. &quot;But you&#39;re different. Everyone knows you&#39;re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You flatter me,&quot; said Dumbledore calmly. &quot;Voldemort had powers I will never have.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Only because you&#39;re too -- well -- noble to use them.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s lucky it&#39;s dark. I haven&#39;t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said &quot;The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around. You know what they&#39;re saying? About why he&#39;s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?&quot;<br /> <br /> It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever &quot;everyone&quot; was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.<br /> <br /> &quot;What they&#39;re saying,&quot; she pressed on, &quot;is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric&#39;s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they&#39;re -- dead.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lily and James... I can&#39;t believe it... I didn&#39;t want to believe it... Oh, Albus...&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. &quot;I know... I know... &quot; he said heavily.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall&#39;s voice trembled as she went on. &quot;That&#39;s not all. They&#39;re saying he tried to kill the Potter&#39;s son, Harry. But he couldn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they&#39;re saying that when he couldn&#39;t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort&#39;s power somehow broke -- and that&#39;s why he&#39;s gone.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore nodded glumly.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s -- it&#39;s true ?&quot; faltered Professor McGonagall. &quot;After all he&#39;s done... all the people he&#39;s killed... he couldn&#39;t kill a little boy? It&#39;s just astounding... of all the things to stop him... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We can only guess,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;We may never know.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, &quot;Hagrid&#39;s late. I suppose it was he who told you I&#39;d be here, by the way?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;And I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re going to tell me why you&#39;re here, of all places?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They&#39;re the only family he has left now.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t mean - you can&#39;t mean the people who live here ?&quot; cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. &quot;Dumbledore -- you can&#39;t. I&#39;ve been watching them all day. You couldn&#39;t find two people who are less like us. And they&#39;ve got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s the best place for him,&quot; said Dumbledore firmly. &quot;His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he&#39;s older. I&#39;ve written them a letter.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A letter?&quot; repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. &quot;Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He&#39;ll be famous -- a legend -- I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Exactly.&quot; said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. &quot;It would be enough to turn any boy&#39;s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won&#39;t even remember! Can you see how much better off he&#39;ll be, growing up away from all that until he&#39;s ready to take it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, &quot;Yes -- yes, you&#39;re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?&quot; She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid&#39;s bringing him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I would trust Hagrid with my life,&quot; said Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not saying his heart isn&#39;t in the right place,&quot; said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, &quot;but you can&#39;t pretend he&#39;s not careless. He does tend to -- what was that?&quot;<br /> <br /> A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky -- and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.<br /> <br /> If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild -- long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid,&quot; said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. &quot;At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,&quot; said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. &quot;Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I&#39;ve got him, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No problems, were there?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, sir -- house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin&#39; around. He fell asleep as we was flyin&#39; over Bristol.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is that where -- ?&quot; whispered Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;He&#39;ll have that scar forever.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Couldn&#39;t you do something about it, Dumbledore?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Even if I could, I wouldn&#39;t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well -- give him here, Hagrid -- we&#39;d better get this over with.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys&#39; house.<br /> <br /> &quot;Could I -- could I say good-bye to him, sir?&quot; asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shhh!&quot; hissed Professor McGonagall, &quot;You&#39;ll wake the Muggles!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;S-s-sorry,&quot; sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. &quot;But I c-c-can&#39;t stand it -- Lily an&#39; James dead -- an&#39; poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, yes, it&#39;s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we&#39;ll be found,&quot; Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry&#39;s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid&#39;s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore&#39;s eyes seemed to have gone out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well,&quot; said Dumbledore finally, &quot;that&#39;s that. We&#39;ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, &quot;I&#39;ll be takin&#39; Sirius his bike back. G&#39;night, Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.<br /> <br /> &quot;I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,&quot; said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good luck, Harry,&quot; he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.<br /> <br /> A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours&#39; time by Mrs. Dursley&#39;s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley... He couldn&#39;t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: &quot;To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived!&quot;</p> "

          "content": "<p> Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys&#39; front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets -- but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.<br /> <br /> Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.<br /> <br /> &quot;Up! Get up! Now!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Up!&quot; she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he&#39;d had the same dream before.<br /> <br /> His aunt was back outside the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you up yet?&quot; she demanded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nearly,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And don&#39;t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy&#39;s birthday.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry groaned.<br /> <br /> &quot;What did you say?&quot; his aunt snapped through the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing, nothing...&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley&#39;s birthday -- how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.<br /> <br /> When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley&#39;s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise -- unless of course it involved punching somebody. Dudley&#39;s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn&#39;t often catch him. Harry didn&#39;t look it, but he was very fast.<br /> <br /> Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley&#39;s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.<br /> <br /> &quot;In the car crash when your parents died,&quot; she had said. &quot;And don&#39;t ask questions.&quot;<br /> <br /> Don&#39;t ask questions -- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.<br /> <br /> &quot;Comb your hair!&quot; he barked, by way of a morning greeting.<br /> <br /> About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way -- all over the place.<br /> <br /> Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel -- Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.<br /> <br /> Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn&#39;t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thirty-six,&quot; he said, looking up at his mother and father. &quot;That&#39;s two less than last year.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Darling, you haven&#39;t counted Auntie Marge&#39;s present, see, it&#39;s here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, thirty-seven then,&quot; said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, &quot;And we&#39;ll buy you another two presents while we&#39;re out today. How&#39;s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, &quot;So I&#39;ll have thirty... thirty...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Thirty-nine, sweetums,&quot; said Aunt Petunia.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh.&quot; Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. &quot;All right then.&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon chuckled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Little tyke wants his money&#39;s worth, just like his father. &#39;Atta boy, Dudley!&quot; He ruffled Dudley&#39;s hair.<br /> <br /> At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bad news, Vernon,&quot; she said. &quot;Mrs. Figg&#39;s broken her leg. She can&#39;t take him.&quot; She jerked her head in Harry&#39;s direction.<br /> <br /> Dudley&#39;s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry&#39;s heart gave a leap. Every year on Dudley&#39;s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she&#39;d ever owned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what?&quot; said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he&#39;d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn&#39;t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.<br /> <br /> &quot;We could phone Marge,&quot; Uncle Vernon suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn&#39;t there -- or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn&#39;t understand them, like a slug.<br /> <br /> &quot;What about what&#39;s-her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;On vacation in Majorca,&quot; snapped Aunt Petunia.<br /> <br /> &quot;You could just leave me here,&quot; Harry put in hopefully (he&#39;d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley&#39;s computer).<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunia looked as though she&#39;d just swallowed a lemon.<br /> <br /> &quot;And come back and find the house in ruins?&quot; she snarled.<br /> <br /> &quot;I won&#39;t blow up the house,&quot; said Harry, but they weren&#39;t listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;I suppose we could take him to the zoo,&quot; said Aunt Petunia slowly, &quot;... and leave him in the car...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That car&#39;s new, he&#39;s not sitting in it alone...&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn&#39;t really crying -- it had been years since he&#39;d really cried -- but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dinky Duddydums, don&#39;t cry, Mummy won&#39;t let him spoil your special day!&quot; she cried, flinging her arms around him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I... don&#39;t... want... him... t-t-to come!&quot; Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. &quot;He always sp-spoils everything!&quot; He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother&#39;s arms.<br /> <br /> Just then, the doorbell rang -- &quot;Oh, good Lord, they&#39;re here!&quot; said Aunt Petunia frantically -- and a moment later, Dudley&#39;s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people&#39;s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.<br /> <br /> Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn&#39;t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys&#39; car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn&#39;t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they&#39;d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m warning you,&quot; he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;m warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you&#39;ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not going to do anything,&quot; said Harry, &quot;honestly...&quot;<br /> <br /> But Uncle Vernon didn&#39;t believe him. No one ever did.<br /> <br /> The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn&#39;t make them happen.<br /> <br /> Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn&#39;t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left &quot;to hide that horrible scar.&quot; Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn&#39;t explain how it had grown back so quickly.<br /> <br /> Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley&#39;s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn&#39;t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn&#39;t punished.<br /> <br /> On the other hand, he&#39;d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley&#39;s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry&#39;s surprise as anyone else&#39;s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry&#39;s headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he&#39;d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.<br /> <br /> But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn&#39;t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg&#39;s cabbage-smelling living room.<br /> <br /> While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.<br /> <br /> &quot;... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,&quot; he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I had a dream about a motorcycle,&quot; said Harry, remembering suddenly. &quot;It was flying.&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: &quot;MOTORCYCLES DON&#39;T FLY!&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley and Piers sniggered.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know they don&#39;t,&quot; said Harry. &quot;It was only a dream.&quot;<br /> <br /> But he wished he hadn&#39;t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn&#39;t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.<br /> <br /> It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn&#39;t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn&#39;t blond.<br /> <br /> Harry had the best morning he&#39;d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn&#39;t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn&#39;t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.<br /> <br /> Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.<br /> <br /> After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon&#39;s car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn&#39;t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.<br /> <br /> Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.<br /> <br /> &quot;Make it move,&quot; he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn&#39;t budge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do it again,&quot; Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is boring,&quot; Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.<br /> <br /> Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.<br /> <br /> The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry&#39;s.<br /> <br /> It winked.<br /> <br /> Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren&#39;t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.<br /> <br /> The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:<br /> <br /> &quot;I get that all the time.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know,&quot; Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn&#39;t sure the snake could hear him. &quot;It must be really annoying.&quot;<br /> <br /> The snake nodded vigorously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where do you come from, anyway?&quot; Harry asked.<br /> <br /> The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.<br /> <br /> Boa Constrictor, Brazil.<br /> <br /> &quot;Was it nice there?&quot;<br /> <br /> The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. &quot;Oh, I see -- so you&#39;ve never been to Brazil?&quot;<br /> <br /> As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. &quot;DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON&#39;T BELIEVE WHAT IT&#39;S DOING!&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.<br /> <br /> &quot;Out of the way, you,&quot; he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.<br /> <br /> Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor&#39;s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.<br /> <br /> As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, &quot;Brazil, here I come... Thanksss, amigo.&quot;<br /> <br /> The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.<br /> <br /> &quot;But the glass,&quot; he kept saying, &quot;where did the glass go?&quot;<br /> <br /> The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn&#39;t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon&#39;s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, &quot;Harry was talking to it, weren&#39;t you, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, &quot;Go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,&quot; before he collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large brandy.<br /> <br /> Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn&#39;t know what time it was and he couldn&#39;t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn&#39;t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.<br /> <br /> He&#39;d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he&#39;d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn&#39;t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn&#39;t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn&#39;t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.<br /> <br /> When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry tried to get a closer look.<br /> <br /> At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley&#39;s gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley&#39;s gang.</p> "

Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley&#39;s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.<br /> <br /> This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn&#39;t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon&#39;s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.<br /> <br /> &quot;They stuff people&#39;s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,&quot; he told Harry. &quot;Want to come upstairs and practice?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, thanks,&quot; said Harry. &quot;The poor toilet&#39;s never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.&quot; Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he&#39;d said.<br /> <br /> One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg&#39;s. Mrs. Figg wasn&#39;t as bad as usual. It turned out she&#39;d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn&#39;t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she&#39;d had it for several years.<br /> <br /> That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings&#39; boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren&#39;t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.<br /> <br /> As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn&#39;t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn&#39;t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.<br /> <br /> There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.<br /> <br /> &quot;Your new school uniform,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> Harry looked in the bowl again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize it had to be so wet.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid,&quot; snapped Aunt Petunia. &quot;I&#39;m dyeing some of Dudley&#39;s old things gray for you. It&#39;ll look just like everyone else&#39;s when I&#39;ve finished.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.<br /> <br /> Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry&#39;s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.<br /> <br /> They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get the mail, Dudley,&quot; said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.<br /> <br /> &quot;Make Harry get it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Get the mail, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Make Dudley get it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon&#39;s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for Harry.<br /> <br /> Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn&#39;t belong to the library, so he&#39;d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:<br /> <br /> Mr. H. Potter<br /> <br /> The Cupboard under the Stairs<br /> <br /> 4 Privet Drive<br /> <br /> Little Whinging<br /> <br /> Surrey<br /> <br /> The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.<br /> <br /> Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hurry up, boy!&quot; shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. &quot;What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?&quot; He chuckled at his own joke.<br /> <br /> Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Marge&#39;s ill,&quot; he informed Aunt Petunia. &quot;Ate a funny whelk...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dad!&quot; said Dudley suddenly. &quot;Dad, Harry&#39;s got something!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s mine!&quot; said Harry, trying to snatch it back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;d be writing to you?&quot; sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn&#39;t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.<br /> <br /> &quot;P-P-Petunia!&quot; he gasped.<br /> <br /> Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.<br /> <br /> &quot;Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!&quot;<br /> <br /> They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn&#39;t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to read that letter,&quot; he said loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to read it,&quot; said Harry furiously, &quot;as it&#39;s mine.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Get out, both of you,&quot; croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t move.<br /> <br /> &quot;I WANT MY LETTER!&quot; he shouted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me see it!&quot; demanded Dudley.<br /> <br /> &quot;OUT!&quot; roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Vernon,&quot; Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, &quot;look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don&#39;t think they&#39;re watching the house?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Watching -- spying -- might be following us,&quot; muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.<br /> <br /> &quot;But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don&#39;t want--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry could see Uncle Vernon&#39;s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; he said finally. &quot;No, we&#39;ll ignore it. If they don&#39;t get an answer... Yes, that&#39;s best... we won&#39;t do anything...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn&#39;t we swear when we took him in we&#39;d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?&quot;<br /> <br /> That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he&#39;d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where&#39;s my letter?&quot; said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. &quot;Who&#39;s writing to me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,&quot; said Uncle Vernon shortly. &quot;I have burned it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was not a mistake,&quot; said Harry angrily, &quot;it had my cupboard on it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;SILENCE!&quot; yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- yes, Harry -- about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking... you&#39;re really getting a bit big for it... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley&#39;s second bedroom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t ask questions!&quot; snapped his uncle. &quot;Take this stuff upstairs, now.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Dursleys&#39; house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon&#39;s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn&#39;t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor&#39;s dog; in the corner was Dudley&#39;s first-ever television set, which he&#39;d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they&#39;d never been touched.<br /> <br /> From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, I don&#39;t want him in there... I need that room... make him get out...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he&#39;d have given anything to be up here. Today he&#39;d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.<br /> <br /> Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He&#39;d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn&#39;t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he&#39;d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.<br /> <br /> When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, &quot;There&#39;s another one! &#39;Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive -- &#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry&#39;s letter clutched in his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom,&quot; he wheezed at Harry. &quot;Dudley -- go -- just go.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn&#39;t received his first letter. Surely that meant they&#39;d try again? And this time he&#39;d make sure they didn&#39;t fail. He had a plan.<br /> <br /> The repaired alarm clock rang at six o&#39;clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn&#39;t wake the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the lights.<br /> <br /> He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door --<br /> <br /> &quot;AAAAARRRGH!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry leapt into the air; he&#39;d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat -- something alive!<br /> <br /> Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle&#39;s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn&#39;t do exactly what he&#39;d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon&#39;s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want -- &quot; he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon didn&#39;t go to work that day. He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.<br /> <br /> &quot;See,&quot; he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, &quot;if they can&#39;t deliver them they&#39;ll just give up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;ll work, Vernon.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, these people&#39;s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they&#39;re not like you and me,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.<br /> <br /> On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn&#39;t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; as he worked, and jumped at small noises.<br /> <br /> On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?&quot; Dudley asked Harry in amazement.<br /> <br /> On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.<br /> <br /> &quot;No post on Sundays,&quot; he reminded them cheerfully as he spread marmalade on his newspapers, &quot;no damn letters today--&quot;<br /> <br /> Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one --<br /> <br /> &quot;Out! OUT!&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;That does it,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. &quot;I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We&#39;re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!&quot;<br /> <br /> He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.<br /> <br /> They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn&#39;t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shake &#39;em off... shake &#39;em off,&quot; he would mutter whenever he did this.<br /> <br /> They didn&#39;t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He&#39;d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he&#39;d missed five television programs he&#39;d wanted to see, and he&#39;d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering...<br /> <br /> They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.<br /> <br /> &quot;&#39;Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an &#39;undred of these at the front desk.&quot;<br /> <br /> She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:<br /> <br /> Mr. H. Potter<br /> <br /> Room 17<br /> <br /> Railview Hotel<br /> <br /> Cokeworth<br /> <br /> Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll take them,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be better just to go home, dear?&quot; Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn&#39;t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.<br /> <br /> &quot;Daddy&#39;s gone mad, hasn&#39;t he?&quot; Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.<br /> <br /> It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s Monday,&quot; he told his mother. &quot;The Great Humberto&#39;s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.&quot;<br /> <br /> Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday -- and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days the week, because of television -- then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry&#39;s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun -- last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon&#39;s old socks. Still, you weren&#39;t eleven every day.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn&#39;t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he&#39;d bought.<br /> <br /> &quot;Found the perfect place!&quot; he said. &quot;Come on! Everyone out!&quot;<br /> <br /> It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.<br /> <br /> &quot;Storm forecast for tonight!&quot; said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. &quot;And this gentleman&#39;s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!&quot;<br /> <br /> A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve already got us some rations,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, &quot;so all aboard!&quot;<br /> <br /> It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.<br /> <br /> The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon&#39;s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Could do with some of those letters now, eh?&quot; he said cheerfully.<br /> <br /> He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn&#39;t cheer him up at all.<br /> <br /> As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.<br /> <br /> The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn&#39;t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley&#39;s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley&#39;s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he&#39;d be eleven in ten minutes&#39; time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.<br /> <br /> Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn&#39;t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he&#39;d be able to steal one somehow.<br /> <br /> Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?<br /> <br /> One minute to go and he&#39;d be eleven. Thirty seconds... twenty... ten... nine -- maybe he&#39;d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three... two... one...<br /> <br /> BOOM.<br /> <br /> The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</p> "

          "content": "<p> BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where&#39;s the cannon?&quot; he said stupidly.<br /> <br /> There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands - now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he shouted. &quot;I warn you -- I&#39;m armed!&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a pause. Then --<br /> <br /> SMASH!<br /> <br /> The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.<br /> <br /> A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.<br /> <br /> The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.<br /> <br /> &quot;Couldn&#39;t make us a cup o&#39; tea, could yeh? It&#39;s not been an easy journey...&quot;<br /> <br /> He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.<br /> <br /> &quot;Budge up, yeh great lump,&quot; said the stranger.<br /> <br /> Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.<br /> <br /> &quot;An&#39; here&#39;s Harry!&quot; said the giant.<br /> <br /> Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.<br /> <br /> &quot;Las&#39; time I saw you, you was only a baby,&quot; said the giant. &quot;Yeh look a lot like yer dad, but yeh&#39;ve got yer mom&#39;s eyes.&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.<br /> <br /> &quot;I demand that you leave at once, sir!&quot; he said. &quot;You are breaking and entering!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,&quot; said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon&#39;s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.<br /> <br /> &quot;Anyway -- Harry,&quot; said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, &quot;a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on it at some point, but it&#39;ll taste all right.&quot;<br /> <br /> From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.<br /> <br /> Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> The giant chuckled.<br /> <br /> &quot;True, I haven&#39;t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry&#39;s whole arm.<br /> <br /> &quot;What about that tea then, eh?&quot; he said, rubbing his hands together. &quot;I&#39;d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh&#39;ve got it, mind.&quot;<br /> <br /> His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn&#39;t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he&#39;d sunk into a hot bath.<br /> <br /> The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, &quot;Don&#39;t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.&quot;<br /> <br /> The giant chuckled darkly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yer great puddin&#39; of a son don&#39; need fattenin&#39; anymore, Dursley, don&#39; worry.&quot;<br /> <br /> He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn&#39;t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I still don&#39;t really know who you are.&quot;<br /> <br /> The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Call me Hagrid,&quot; he said, &quot;everyone does. An&#39; like I told yeh, I&#39;m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- yeh&#39;ll know all about Hogwarts, o&#39; course.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- no,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked shocked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; Harry said quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry ?&quot; barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. &quot;It&#39;s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren&#39;t gettin&#39; yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn&#39;t even know abou&#39; Hogwarts, fer cryin&#39; out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All what?&quot; asked Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;ALL WHAT?&quot; Hagrid thundered. &quot;Now wait jus&#39; one second!&quot;<br /> <br /> He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you mean ter tell me,&quot; he growled at the Dursleys, &quot;that this boy -- this boy! -- knows nothin&#39; abou&#39; -- about ANYTHING?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren&#39;t bad.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know some things,&quot; he said. &quot;I can, you know, do math and stuff.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, &quot;About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents&#39; world.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What world?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.<br /> <br /> &quot;DURSLEY!&quot; he boomed.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like &quot;Mimblewimble.&quot; Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, they&#39;re famous. You&#39;re famous.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What? My -- my mom and dad weren&#39;t famous, were they?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh don&#39; know... yeh don&#39; know... &quot; Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh don&#39; know what yeh are ?&quot; he said finally.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!&quot;<br /> <br /> A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled with rage.<br /> <br /> &quot;You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An&#39; you&#39;ve kept it from him all these years?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Kept what from me?&quot; said Harry eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;STOP! I FORBID YOU!&quot; yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Harry -- yer a wizard.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling wind could be heard.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m a what ?&quot; gasped Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;A wizard, o&#39; course,&quot; said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, &quot;an&#39; a thumpin&#39; good &#39;un, I&#39;d say, once yeh&#39;ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an&#39; dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An&#39; I reckon it&#39;s abou&#39; time yeh read yer letter.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:<br /> <br /> HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY<br /> <br /> Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<br /> <br /> (Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards)<br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Potter,<br /> <br /> We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.<br /> <br /> Term begins on September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.<br /> <br /> Yours sincerely,<br /> <br /> Minerva McGonagall,<br /> <br /> Deputy Headmistress<br /> <br /> Questions exploded inside Harry&#39;s head like fireworks and he couldn&#39;t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stammered, &quot;What does it mean, they await my owl?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Gallopin&#39; Gorgons, that reminds me,&quot; said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl -- a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:<br /> <br /> Dear Professor Dumbledore,<br /> <br /> Given Harry his letter.<br /> <br /> Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.<br /> <br /> Weather&#39;s horrible. Hope you&#39;re well.<br /> <br /> Hagrid<br /> <br /> Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.<br /> <br /> Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where was I?&quot; said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s not going,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Hagrid grunted.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;A what?&quot; said Harry, interested.<br /> <br /> &quot;A Muggle,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;it&#39;s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An&#39; it&#39;s your bad luck you grew up in a family o&#39; the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We swore when we took him in we&#39;d put a stop to that rubbish,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, &quot;swore we&#39;d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You knew ?&quot; said Harry. &quot;You knew I&#39;m a -- a wizard?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Knew!&quot; shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. &quot;Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that -- that school -- and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!&quot;<br /> <br /> She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.<br /> <br /> &quot;Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you&#39;d be just the same, just as strange, just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, &quot;Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;CAR CRASH!&quot; roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. &quot;How could a car crash kill Lily an&#39; James Potter? It&#39;s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin&#39; his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But why? What happened?&quot; Harry asked urgently.<br /> <br /> The anger faded from Hagrid&#39;s face. He looked suddenly anxious.<br /> <br /> &quot;I never expected this,&quot; he said, in a low, worried voice. &quot;I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin&#39; hold of yeh, how much yeh didn&#39;t know. Ah, Harry, I don&#39; know if I&#39;m the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone&#39;s gotta -- yeh can&#39;t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, it&#39;s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind, I can&#39;t tell yeh everythin&#39;, it&#39;s a great myst&#39;ry, parts of it...&quot;<br /> <br /> He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, &quot;It begins, I suppose, with -- with a person called -- but it&#39;s incredible yeh don&#39;t know his name, everyone in our world knows--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well -- I don&#39; like sayin&#39; the name if I can help it. No one does.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why not?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Gulpin&#39; gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went... bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Could you write it down?&quot; Harry suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nah -- can&#39;t spell it. All right -- Voldemort.&quot; Hagrid shuddered. &quot;Don&#39; make me say it again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin&#39; fer followers. Got &#39;em, too -- some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o&#39; his power, &#39;cause he was gettin&#39; himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn&#39;t know who ter trust, didn&#39;t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches... terrible things happened. He was takin&#39; over. &#39;Course, some stood up to him -- an&#39; he killed &#39;em. Horribly. One o&#39; the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore&#39;s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn&#39;t dare try takin&#39; the school, not jus&#39; then, anyway.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, yer mum an&#39; dad were as good a witch an&#39; wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an&#39; girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst&#39;ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get &#39;em on his side before... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin&#39; ter do with the Dark Side.<br /> <br /> &quot;Maybe he thought he could persuade &#39;em... maybe he just wanted &#39;em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an&#39; -- an&#39;--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&#39;s that sad -- knew yer mum an&#39; dad, an&#39; nicer people yeh couldn&#39;t find -- anyway...<br /> <br /> &quot;You-Know-Who killed &#39;em. An&#39; then -- an&#39; this is the real myst&#39;ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin&#39; by then. But he couldn&#39;t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That&#39;s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an&#39; dad an&#39; yer house, even -- but it didn&#39;t work on you, an&#39; that&#39;s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill &#39;em, no one except you, an&#39; he&#39;d killed some o&#39; the best witches an&#39; wizards of the age -- the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts -- an&#39; you was only a baby, an&#39; you lived.&quot;<br /> <br /> Something very painful was going on in Harry&#39;s mind. As Hagrid&#39;s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before -- and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.<br /> <br /> Hagrid was watching him sadly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore&#39;s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Load of old tosh,&quot; said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, you listen here, boy,&quot; he snarled, &quot;I accept there&#39;s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn&#39;t have cured -- and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdoes, no denying it, and the world&#39;s better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected, always knew they&#39;d come to a sticky end--&quot;<br /> <br /> But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, &quot;I&#39;m warning you, Dursley -- I&#39;m warning you -- one more word...&quot;<br /> <br /> In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon&#39;s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.<br /> <br /> Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.<br /> <br /> &quot;But what happened to Vol-, sorry -- I mean, You-Know-Who?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That&#39;s the biggest myst&#39;ry, see... he was gettin&#39; more an&#39; more powerful -- why&#39;d he go?<br /> <br /> &quot;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he&#39;s still out there, bidin&#39; his time, like, but I don&#39; believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of &#39;em came outta kinda trances. Don&#39; reckon they could&#39;ve done if he was comin&#39; back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Most of us reckon he&#39;s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. &#39;Cause somethin&#39; about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin&#39; goin&#39; on that night he hadn&#39;t counted on -- I dunno what it was, no one does -- but somethin&#39; about you stumped him, all right.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He&#39;d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn&#39;t they been turned into warty toads every time they&#39;d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he&#39;d once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;I think you must have made a mistake. I don&#39;t think I can be a wizard.&quot;<br /> <br /> To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it... every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry... chased by Dudley&#39;s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach... dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he&#39;d managed to make it grow back... and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn&#39;t he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn&#39;t he set a boa constrictor on him?<br /> <br /> Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;See?&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Harry Potter, not a wizard -- you wait, you&#39;ll be right famous at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Uncle Vernon wasn&#39;t going to give in without a fight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Haven&#39;t I told you he&#39;s not going?&quot; he hissed. &quot;He&#39;s going to Stonewall High and he&#39;ll be grateful for it. I&#39;ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won&#39;t stop him,&quot; growled Hagrid. &quot;Stop Lily an&#39; James Potter&#39;s son goin&#39; ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name&#39;s been down ever since he was born. He&#39;s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won&#39;t know himself. He&#39;ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an&#39; he&#39;ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!&quot; yelled Uncle Vernon.<br /> <br /> But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, &quot;NEVER -- &quot; he thundered, &quot; -- INSULT -- ALBUS -- DUMBLEDORE -- IN -- FRONT -- OF -- ME!&quot;<br /> <br /> He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley -- there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig&#39;s tail poking through a hole in his trousers.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shouldn&#39;ta lost me temper,&quot; he said ruefully, &quot;but it didn&#39;t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn&#39;t much left ter do.&quot;<br /> <br /> He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.<br /> <br /> &quot;Be grateful if yeh didn&#39;t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin&#39;. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an&#39; get yer letters to yeh an&#39; stuff -- one o&#39; the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why aren&#39;t you supposed to do magic?&quot; asked Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an&#39; everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why were you expelled?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s gettin&#39; late and we&#39;ve got lots ter do tomorrow,&quot; said Hagrid loudly. &quot;Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an&#39; that.&quot;<br /> <br /> He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can kip under that,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#39; mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o&#39; doormice in one o&#39; the pockets.&quot;</p> "

          "content": "<p> Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was a dream, he told himself firmly. &quot;I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I&#39;ll be at home in my cupboard.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.<br /> <br /> And there&#39;s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn&#39;t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.<br /> <br /> Tap. Tap. Tap.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right,&quot; Harry mumbled, &quot;I&#39;m getting up.&quot;<br /> <br /> He sat up and Hagrid&#39;s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.<br /> <br /> Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn&#39;t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid&#39;s coat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t do that.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot; said Harry loudly. &quot;There&#39;s an owl--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Pay him,&quot; Hagrid grunted into the sofa.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He wants payin&#39; fer deliverin&#39; the paper. Look in the pockets.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets -- bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give him five Knuts,&quot; said Hagrid sleepily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Knuts?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The little bronze ones.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.<br /> <br /> Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.<br /> <br /> &quot;Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an&#39; buy all yer stuff fer school.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.<br /> <br /> &quot;Um -- Hagrid?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Mm?&quot; said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.<br /> <br /> &quot;I haven&#39;t got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night... he won&#39;t pay for me to go and learn magic.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that,&quot; said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. &quot;D&#39;yeh think yer parents didn&#39;t leave yeh anything?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But if their house was destroyed--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They didn&#39; keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards&#39; bank. Have a sausage, they&#39;re not bad cold -- an&#39; I wouldn&#39; say no teh a bit o&#39; yer birthday cake, neither.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wizards have banks ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.<br /> <br /> &quot;Goblins ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah -- so yeh&#39;d be mad ter try an&#39; rob it, I&#39;ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- &#39;cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o&#39; fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.&quot; Hagrid drew himself up proudly. &quot;He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin&#39; you -- gettin&#39; things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me, see.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Got everythin&#39;? Come on, then.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.<br /> <br /> &quot;How did you get here?&quot; Harry asked, looking around for another boat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Flew,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Flew ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah -- but we&#39;ll go back in this. Not s&#39;pposed ter use magic now I&#39;ve got yeh.&quot;<br /> <br /> They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.<br /> <br /> &quot;Seems a shame ter row, though,&quot; said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. &quot;If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin&#39; it at Hogwarts?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course not,&quot; said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?&quot; Harry asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Spells -- enchantments,&quot; said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. &quot;They say there&#39;s dragons guardin&#39; the high security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh&#39;d die of hunger tryin&#39; ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he&#39;d never had so many questions in his life.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ministry o&#39; Magic messin&#39; things up as usual,&quot; Hagrid muttered, turning the page.<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s a Ministry of Magic?&quot; Harry asked, before he could stop himself.<br /> <br /> &quot;&#39;Course,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o&#39; course, but he&#39;d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin&#39; fer advice.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But what does a Ministry of Magic do ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there&#39;s still witches an&#39; wizards up an&#39; down the country.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone&#39;d be wantin&#39; magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we&#39;re best left alone.&quot;<br /> <br /> At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street.<br /> <br /> Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn&#39;t blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, &quot;See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid,&quot; said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, &quot;did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, so they say,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Crikey, I&#39;d like a dragon.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d like one?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go.&quot;<br /> <br /> They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes&#39; time. Hagrid, who didn&#39;t understand &quot;Muggle money,&quot; as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.<br /> <br /> People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.<br /> <br /> &quot;Still got yer letter, Harry?&quot; he asked as he counted stitches.<br /> <br /> Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;There&#39;s a list there of everything yeh need.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn&#39;t noticed the night before, and read:<br /> <br /> HOGWARTS SCHOOL o f WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY<br /> <br /> UNIFORM<br /> <br /> First-year students will require:<br /> <br /> 1.

Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know how the Muggles manage without magic,&quot; he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.<br /> <br /> Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn&#39;t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn&#39;t help trusting him.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is it,&quot; said Hagrid, coming to a halt, &quot;the Leaky Cauldron. It&#39;s a famous place.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn&#39;t pointed it out, Harry wouldn&#39;t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn&#39;t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn&#39;t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.<br /> <br /> For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, &quot;The usual, Hagrid?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t, Tom, I&#39;m on Hogwarts business,&quot; said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry&#39;s shoulder and making Harry&#39;s knees buckle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good Lord,&quot; said the bartender, peering at Harry, &quot;is this -- can this be -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bless my soul,&quot; whispered the old bartender, &quot;Harry Potter... what an honor.&quot;<br /> <br /> He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.<br /> <br /> Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can&#39;t believe I&#39;m meeting you at last.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So proud, Mr. Potter, I&#39;m just so proud.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Always wanted to shake your hand -- I&#39;m all of a flutter.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can&#39;t tell you, Diggle&#39;s the name, Dedalus Diggle.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve seen you before!&quot; said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle&#39;s top hat fell off in his excitement. &quot;You bowed to me once in a shop.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He remembers!&quot; cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. &quot;Did you hear that? He remembers me!&quot; Harry shook hands again and again -- Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.<br /> <br /> A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Quirrell!&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;P-P-Potter,&quot; stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry&#39;s hand, &quot;c-can&#39;t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,&quot; muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he&#39;d rather not think about it. &quot;N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?&quot; He laughed nervously. &quot;You&#39;ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I&#39;ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.&quot; He looked terrified at the very thought.<br /> <br /> But the others wouldn&#39;t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble.<br /> <br /> &quot;Must get on -- lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> Doris Crockford shook Harry&#39;s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.<br /> <br /> Hagrid grinned at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Told yeh, didn&#39;t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin&#39; ter meet yeh -- mind you, he&#39;s usually tremblin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Is he always that nervous?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin&#39; outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o&#39; trouble with a hag -- never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject -- now, where&#39;s me umbrella?&quot;<br /> <br /> Vampires? Hags? Harry&#39;s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.<br /> <br /> &quot;Three up... two across... &quot; he muttered. &quot;Right, stand back, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.<br /> <br /> The brick he had touched quivered -- it wriggled -- in the middle, a small hole appeared -- it grew wider and wider -- a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Welcome,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;to Diagon Alley.&quot;<br /> <br /> He grinned at Harry&#39;s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.<br /> <br /> The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons -- All Sizes -- Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver -- Self-Stirring -- Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll be needin&#39; one,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;but we gotta get yer money first.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, &quot;Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they&#39;re mad...&quot;<br /> <br /> A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry&#39;s age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. &quot;Look,&quot; Harry heard one of them say, &quot;the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever -- &quot; There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels&#39; eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon...<br /> <br /> &quot;Gringotts,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was --<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s a goblin,&quot; said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them:<br /> <br /> Enter, stranger, but take heed<br /> <br /> Of what awaits the sin of greed,<br /> <br /> For those who take, but do not earn,<br /> <br /> Must pay most dearly in their turn.<br /> <br /> So if you seek beneath our floors<br /> <br /> A treasure that was never yours,<br /> <br /> Thief, you have been warned, beware<br /> <br /> Of finding more than treasure there.<br /> <br /> &quot;Like I said, Yeh&#39;d be mad ter try an&#39; rob it,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.<br /> <br /> &quot;Morning,&quot; said Hagrid to a free goblin. &quot;We&#39;ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter&#39;s safe.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You have his key, sir?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Got it here somewhere,&quot; said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblin&#39;s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.<br /> <br /> &quot;Got it,&quot; said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.<br /> <br /> The goblin looked at it closely.<br /> <br /> &quot;That seems to be in order.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;An&#39; I&#39;ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,&quot; said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. &quot;It&#39;s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.&quot;<br /> <br /> The goblin read the letter carefully.<br /> <br /> &quot;Very well,&quot; he said, handing it back to Hagrid, &quot;I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!&quot;<br /> <br /> Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?&quot; Harry asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t tell yeh that,&quot; said Hagrid mysteriously. &quot;Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore&#39;s trusted me. More&#39;n my job&#39;s worth ter tell yeh that.&quot;<br /> <br /> Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in -- Hagrid with some difficulty -- and were off.<br /> <br /> At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn&#39;t steering.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late -- they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;I never know,&quot; Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, &quot;what&#39;s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Stalagmite&#39;s got an &#39;m&#39; in it,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;An&#39; don&#39; ask me questions just now, I think I&#39;m gonna be sick.&quot;<br /> <br /> He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.<br /> <br /> Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.<br /> <br /> &quot;All yours,&quot; smiled Hagrid.<br /> <br /> All Harry&#39;s -- it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn&#39;t have known about this or they&#39;d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London.<br /> <br /> Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.<br /> <br /> &quot;The gold ones are Galleons,&quot; he explained. &quot;Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it&#39;s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o&#39; terms, we&#39;ll keep the rest safe for yeh.&quot; He turned to Griphook. &quot;Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;One speed only,&quot; said Griphook.<br /> <br /> They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.<br /> <br /> Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stand back,&quot; said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.<br /> <br /> &quot;If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they&#39;d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,&quot; said Griphook.<br /> <br /> &quot;How often do you check to see if anyone&#39;s inside?&quot; Harry asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;About once every ten years,&quot; said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.<br /> <br /> Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don&#39;t talk to me on the way back, it&#39;s best if I keep me mouth shut,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn&#39;t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn&#39;t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he&#39;d had in his whole life -- more money than even Dudley had ever had.<br /> <br /> &quot;Might as well get yer uniform,&quot; said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin&#39;s Robes for All Occasions. &quot;Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.&quot; He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin&#39;s shop alone, feeling nervous.<br /> <br /> Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hogwarts, dear?&quot; she said, when Harry started to speak. &quot;Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.&quot;<br /> <br /> In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello,&quot; said the boy, &quot;Hogwarts, too?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;My father&#39;s next door buying my books and mother&#39;s up the street looking at wands,&quot; said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. &quot;Then I&#39;m going to drag them off to took at racing brooms. I don&#39;t see why first years can&#39;t have their own. I think I&#39;ll bully father into getting me one and I&#39;ll smuggle it in somehow.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you got your own broom?&quot; the boy went on.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Play Quidditch at all?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be.<br /> <br /> &quot;I do -- Father says it&#39;s a crime if I&#39;m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you&#39;ll be in yet?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I&#39;ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I&#39;d leave, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Mmm,&quot; said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting.<br /> <br /> &quot;I say, look at that man!&quot; said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn&#39;t come in.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s Hagrid,&quot; said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn&#39;t. &quot;He works at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; said the boy, &quot;I&#39;ve heard of him. He&#39;s a sort of servant, isn&#39;t he?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s the gamekeeper,&quot; said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, exactly. I heard he&#39;s a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I think he&#39;s brilliant,&quot; said Harry coldly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you?&quot; said the boy, with a slight sneer. &quot;Why is he with you? Where are your parents?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;re dead,&quot; said Harry shortly. He didn&#39;t feel much like going into the matter with this boy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; said the other, not sounding sorry at all. &quot;But they were our kind, weren&#39;t they?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They were a witch and wizard, if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I really don&#39;t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They&#39;re just not the same, they&#39;ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What&#39;s your surname, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, &quot;That&#39;s you done, my dear,&quot; and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I&#39;ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,&quot; said the drawling boy.<br /> <br /> Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing,&quot; Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, &quot;Hagrid, what&#39;s Quidditch?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin&#39; how little yeh know -- not knowin&#39; about Quidditch!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t make me feel worse,&quot; said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin&#39;s.<br /> <br /> &quot;-- and he said people from Muggle families shouldn&#39;t even be allowed in--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yer not from a Muggle family. If he&#39;d known who yeh were -- he&#39;s grown up knowin&#39; yer name if his parents are wizardin&#39; folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o&#39; the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in &#39;em in a long line o&#39; Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So what is Quidditch?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s our sport. Wizard sport. It&#39;s like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there&#39;s four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;School houses. There&#39;s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o&#39; duffers, but--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I bet I&#39;m in Hufflepuff,&quot; said Harry gloomily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,&quot; said Hagrid darkly. &quot;There&#39;s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn&#39;t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Vol-, sorry -- You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Years an&#39; years ago,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> They bought Harry&#39;s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.<br /> <br /> &quot;I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not sayin&#39; that&#39;s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;An&#39; anyway, yeh couldn&#39; work any of them curses yet, yeh&#39;ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid wouldn&#39;t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (&quot;It says pewter on yer list&quot;), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).<br /> <br /> Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry&#39;s list again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just yer wand left -- A yeah, an&#39; I still haven&#39;t got yeh a birthday present.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt himself go red.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t have to--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know I don&#39;t have to. Tell yeh what, I&#39;ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh&#39;d be laughed at -- an&#39; I don&#39; like cats, they make me sneeze. I&#39;ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they&#39;re dead useful, carry yer mail an&#39; everythin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn&#39;t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39; mention it,&quot; said Hagrid gruffly. &quot;Don&#39; expect you&#39;ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now -- only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.&quot;<br /> <br /> A magic wand... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.<br /> <br /> The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.<br /> <br /> A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair.<br /> <br /> An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello,&quot; said Harry awkwardly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah yes,&quot; said the man. &quot;Yes, yes. I thought I&#39;d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. &quot;You have your mother&#39;s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it -- it&#39;s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;And that&#39;s where...&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry&#39;s forehead with a long, white finger.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands... well, if I&#39;d known what that wand was going out into the world to do...&quot;<br /> <br /> He shook his head and then, to Harry&#39;s relief, spotted Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was, sir, yes,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?&quot; said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- yes, they did, yes,&quot; said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. &quot;I&#39;ve still got the pieces, though,&quot; he added brightly.<br /> <br /> &quot;But you don&#39;t use them?&quot; said Mr. Ollivander sharply.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no, sir,&quot; said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hmmm,&quot; said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. &quot;Well, now -- Mr. Potter. Let me see.&quot; He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. &quot;Which is your wand arm?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- well, I&#39;m right-handed,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hold out your arm. That&#39;s it.&quot; He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, &quot;Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard&#39;s wand.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.<br /> <br /> &quot;That will do,&quot; he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. &quot;Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it a wave.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried -- but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, no -- here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.<br /> <br /> &quot;Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we&#39;ll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder, now -- yes, why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, &quot;Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well... how curious... how very curious...&quot;<br /> <br /> He put Harry&#39;s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, &quot;Curious... curious...<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Harry, &quot;but what&#39;s curious?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.<br /> <br /> &quot;I remember every wand I&#39;ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather -- just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother -- why, its brother gave you that scar.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry swallowed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember... I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter... After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible, yes, but great.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shivered. He wasn&#39;t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.<br /> <br /> The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn&#39;t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn&#39;t even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry&#39;s lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.<br /> <br /> &quot;Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.<br /> <br /> &quot;You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> Harry wasn&#39;t sure he could explain. He&#39;d just had the best birthday of his life -- and yet -- he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone thinks I&#39;m special,&quot; he said at last. &quot;All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander... but I don&#39;t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I&#39;m famous and I can&#39;t even remember what I&#39;m famous for. I don&#39;t know what happened when Vol-, sorry -- I mean, the night my parents died.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39; you worry, Harry. You&#39;ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you&#39;ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it&#39;s hard. Yeh&#39;ve been singled out, an&#39; that&#39;s always hard. But yeh&#39;ll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do, &#39;smatter of fact.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, &quot; he said. &quot;First o&#39; September -- King&#39;s Cross -- it&#39;s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she&#39;ll know where to find me... See yeh soon, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</p> "

          "title": "The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-quarters",
          "content": "<p> Harry&#39;s last month with the Dursleys wasn&#39;t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn&#39;t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn&#39;t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him -- in fact, they didn&#39;t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.<br /> <br /> Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn&#39;t come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.<br /> <br /> On the last day of August he thought he&#39;d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King&#39;s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- Uncle Vernon?&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- I need to be at King&#39;s Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon grunted again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?&quot;<br /> <br /> Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br /> <br /> He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.<br /> <br /> &quot;Funny way to get to a wizards&#39; school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t say anything.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where is this school, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.<br /> <br /> &quot;I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o&#39;clock,&quot; he read.<br /> <br /> His aunt and uncle stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;Platform what?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nine and three-quarters.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t talk rubbish,&quot; said Uncle Vernon. &quot;There is no platform nine and three-quarters.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s on my ticket.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Barking,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, &quot;howling mad, the lot of them. You&#39;ll see. You just wait. All right, we&#39;ll take you to King&#39;s Cross. We&#39;re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn&#39;t bother.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why are you going to London?&quot; Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Taking Dudley to the hospital,&quot; growled Uncle Vernon. &quot;Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry woke at five o&#39;clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn&#39;t want to walk into the station in his wizard&#39;s robes -- he&#39;d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry&#39;s huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys&#39; car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.<br /> <br /> They reached King&#39;s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry&#39;s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine -- platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don&#39;t seem to have built it yet, do they?&quot;<br /> <br /> He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have a good term,&quot; said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry&#39;s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He&#39;d have to ask someone.<br /> <br /> He stopped a passing guard, but didn&#39;t dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn&#39;t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o&#39;clock, but the guard said there wasn&#39;t one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.<br /> <br /> Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector&#39;s stand between platforms nine and ten.<br /> <br /> At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.<br /> <br /> &quot;-- packed with Muggles, of course--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry&#39;s in front of him -- and they had an owl.<br /> <br /> Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, what&#39;s the platform number?&quot; said the boys&#39; mother.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nine and three-quarters!&quot; piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, &quot;Mom, can&#39;t I go...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.&quot;<br /> <br /> What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it -- but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fred, you next,&quot; the plump woman said.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not Fred, I&#39;m George,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can&#39;t you tell I&#39;m George?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry, George, dear.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Only joking, I am Fred,&quot; said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone -- but how had he done it?<br /> <br /> Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier he was almost there -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn&#39;t anywhere.<br /> <br /> There was nothing else for it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Harry said to the plump woman.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello, dear,&quot; she said. &quot;First time at Hogwarts? Ron&#39;s new, too.&quot;<br /> <br /> She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry. &quot;The thing is -- the thing is, I don&#39;t know how to--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How to get onto the platform?&quot; she said kindly, and Harry nodded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not to worry,&quot; she said. &quot;All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don&#39;t stop and don&#39;t be scared you&#39;ll crash into it, that&#39;s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you&#39;re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- okay,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid.<br /> <br /> He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he&#39;d be in trouble -- leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run -- the barrier was coming nearer and nearer -- he wouldn&#39;t be able to stop -- the cart was out of control -- he was a foot away -- he closed his eyes ready for the crash --<br /> <br /> It didn&#39;t come... he kept on running... he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts&#39; Express, eleven o&#39;clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had done it.<br /> <br /> Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.<br /> <br /> The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, &quot;Gran, I&#39;ve lost my toad again.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Neville,&quot; he heard the old woman sigh.<br /> <br /> A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give us a look, Lee, go on.&quot;<br /> <br /> The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.<br /> <br /> Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.<br /> <br /> &quot;Want a hand?&quot; It was one of the red-haired twins he&#39;d followed through the barrier.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, please,&quot; Harry panted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oy, Fred! C&#39;mere and help!&quot;<br /> <br /> With the twins&#39; help, Harry&#39;s trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry&#39;s lightning scar.<br /> <br /> &quot;Blimey,&quot; said the other twin. &quot;Are you -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He is,&quot; said the first twin. &quot;Aren&#39;t you?&quot; he added to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter.&quot; chorused the twins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, him,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I mean, yes, I am.&quot;<br /> <br /> The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train&#39;s open door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fred? George? Are you there?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Coming, Mom.&quot;<br /> <br /> With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train.<br /> <br /> Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron, you&#39;ve got something on your nose.&quot;<br /> <br /> The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mom -- geroff&quot; He wriggled free.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?&quot; said one of the twins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where&#39;s Percy?&quot; said their mother.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s coming now.&quot;<br /> <br /> The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge on his chest with the letter P on it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t stay long, Mother,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?&quot; said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. &quot;You should have said something, we had no idea.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,&quot; said the other twin. &quot;Once--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Or twice--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A minute--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All summer--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; said Percy the Prefect.<br /> <br /> &quot;How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?&quot; said one of the twins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Because he&#39;s a prefect,&quot; said their mother fondly. &quot;All right, dear, well, have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there.&quot;<br /> <br /> She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, you two -- this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you&#39;ve -- you&#39;ve blown up a toilet or--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Blown up a toilet? We&#39;ve never blown up a toilet.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Great idea though, thanks, Mom.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not funny. And look after Ron.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up,&quot; said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn&#39;t see him looking.<br /> <br /> &quot;You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? Know who he is?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry heard the little girl&#39;s voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, eh please...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn&#39;t something you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Asked him. Saw his scar. It&#39;s really there -- like lightning.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Poor dear -- no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?&quot;<br /> <br /> Their mother suddenly became very stern.<br /> <br /> &quot;I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don&#39;t you dare. As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, keep your hair on.&quot;<br /> <br /> A whistle sounded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hurry up!&quot; their mother said, and the three boys clambered onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t, Ginny, we&#39;ll send you loads of owls.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll send you a Hogwarts&#39; toilet seat.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;George!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Only joking, Mom.&quot;<br /> <br /> The train began to move. Harry saw the boys&#39; mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.<br /> <br /> Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a great leap of excitement. He didn&#39;t know what he was going to -- but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.<br /> <br /> The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in.<br /> <br /> &quot;Anyone sitting there?&quot; he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry. &quot;Everywhere else is full.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he hadn&#39;t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hey, Ron.&quot;<br /> <br /> The twins were back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Listen, we&#39;re going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan&#39;s got a giant tarantula down there.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; mumbled Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry,&quot; said the other twin, &quot;did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bye,&quot; said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you really Harry Potter?&quot; Ron blurted out.<br /> <br /> Harry nodded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh -- well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George&#39;s jokes,&quot; said Ron. &quot;And have you really got -- you know...&quot;<br /> <br /> He pointed at Harry&#39;s forehead.<br /> <br /> Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;So that&#39;s where You-Know-Who -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry, &quot;but I can&#39;t remember it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing?&quot; said Ron eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well -- I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wow,&quot; said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out of the window again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are all your family wizards?&quot; asked Harry, who found Ron just as interesting as Ron found him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- Yes, I think so,&quot; said Ron. &quot;I think Mom&#39;s got a second cousin who&#39;s an accountant, but we never talk about him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So you must know loads of magic already.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.<br /> <br /> &quot;I heard you went to live with Muggles,&quot; said Ron. &quot;What are they like?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Horrible -- well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I&#39;d had three wizard brothers.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Five,&quot; said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. &quot;I&#39;m the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I&#39;ve got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy&#39;s a prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they&#39;re really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it&#39;s no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I&#39;ve got Bill&#39;s old robes, Charlie&#39;s old wand, and Percy&#39;s old rat.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which was asleep.<br /> <br /> &quot;His name&#39;s Scabbers and he&#39;s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they couldn&#39;t aff -- I mean, I got Scabbers instead.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s ears went pink. He seemed to think he&#39;d said too much, because he went back to staring out of the window.<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. After all, he&#39;d never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear Dudley&#39;s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed to cheer Ron up.<br /> <br /> &quot;... and until Hagrid told me, I didn&#39;t know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron gasped.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You said You-Know-Who&#39;s name!&quot; said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. &quot;I&#39;d have thought you, of all people--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,&quot; said Harry, &quot;I just never knew you shouldn&#39;t. See what I mean? I&#39;ve got loads to learn... I bet,&quot; he added, voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately, &quot;I bet I&#39;m the worst in the class.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You won&#39;t be. There&#39;s loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough.&quot;<br /> <br /> While they had been talking, the train had carried them out of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes flick past.<br /> <br /> Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, &quot;Anything off the cart, dears?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, who hadn&#39;t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron&#39;s ears went pink again and he muttered that he&#39;d brought sandwiches. Harry went out into the corridor.<br /> <br /> He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn&#39;t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott&#39;s Every Flavor Beans, Drooble&#39;s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.<br /> <br /> Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hungry, are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Starving,&quot; said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty.<br /> <br /> Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, &quot;She always forgets I don&#39;t like corned beef..&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Swap you for one of these,&quot; said Harry, holding up a pasty. &quot;Go on--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t want this, it&#39;s all dry,&quot; said Ron. &quot;She hasn&#39;t got much time,&quot; he added quickly, &quot;you know, with five of us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go on, have a pasty,&quot; said Harry, who had never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry&#39;s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).<br /> <br /> &quot;What are these?&quot; Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Chocolate Frogs. &quot;They&#39;re not really frogs, are they?&quot; He was starting to feel that nothing would surprise him.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Ron. &quot;But see what the card is. I&#39;m missing Agrippa.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, of course, you wouldn&#39;t know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect -- famous witches and wizards. I&#39;ve got about five hundred, but I haven&#39;t got Agrippa or Ptolemy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It showed a man&#39;s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> &quot;So this is Dumbledore!&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;d never heard of Dumbledore!&quot; said Ron. &quot;Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa -- thanks--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry turned over his card and read:<br /> <br /> ALBUS DUMBLEDORE<br /> <br /> CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS<br /> <br /> Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#39;s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.<br /> <br /> Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that Dumbledore&#39;s face had disappeared.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s gone!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, you can&#39;t expect him to hang around all day,&quot; said Ron. &quot;He&#39;ll be back. No, I&#39;ve got Morgana again and I&#39;ve got about six of her... do you want it? You can start collecting.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Help yourself,&quot; said Harry. &quot;But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do they? What, they don&#39;t move at all?&quot; Ron sounded amazed. &quot;Weird!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn&#39;t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away from the Druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott&#39;s Every Flavor Beans.<br /> <br /> &quot;You want to be careful with those,&quot; Ron warned Harry. &quot;When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bleaaargh -- see? Sprouts.&quot;<br /> <br /> They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one Ron wouldn&#39;t touch, which turned out to be pepper.<br /> <br /> The countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.<br /> <br /> There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-quarters came in. He looked tearful.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; he said, &quot;but have you seen a toad at all?&quot;<br /> <br /> When they shook their heads, he wailed, &quot;I&#39;ve lost him! He keeps getting away from me!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;ll turn up,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said the boy miserably. &quot;Well, if you see him...&quot;<br /> <br /> He left.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t know why he&#39;s so bothered,&quot; said Ron. &quot;If I&#39;d brought a toad I&#39;d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can&#39;t talk.&quot;<br /> <br /> The rat was still snoozing on Ron&#39;s lap.<br /> <br /> &quot;He might have died and you wouldn&#39;t know the difference,&quot; said Ron in disgust. &quot;I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting, but the spell didn&#39;t work. I&#39;ll show you, look...&quot;<br /> <br /> He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something white was glinting at the end.<br /> <br /> &quot;Unicorn hair&#39;s nearly poking out. Anyway--&quot;<br /> <br /> He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Has anyone seen a toad? Neville&#39;s lost one,&quot; she said. She had a bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve already told him we haven&#39;t seen it,&quot; said Ron, but the girl wasn&#39;t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, are you doing magic? Let&#39;s see it, then.&quot;<br /> <br /> She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- all right.&quot;<br /> <br /> He cleared his throat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,<br /> <br /> Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.&quot;<br /> <br /> He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you sure that&#39;s a real spell?&quot; said the girl. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not very good, is it? I&#39;ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it&#39;s all worked for me. Nobody in my family&#39;s magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course, I mean, it&#39;s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I&#39;ve heard -- I&#39;ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it will be enough -- I&#39;m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> She said all this very fast.<br /> <br /> Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face that he hadn&#39;t learned all the course books by heart either.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m Ron Weasley,&quot; Ron muttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you really?&quot; said Hermione. &quot;I know all about you, of course -- I got a few extra books, for background reading, and you&#39;re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Am I?&quot; said Harry, feeling dazed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Goodness, didn&#39;t you know, I&#39;d have found out everything I could if it was me,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Do either of you know what house you&#39;ll be in? I&#39;ve been asking around, and I hope I&#39;m in Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn&#39;t be too bad... Anyway, we&#39;d better go and look for Neville&#39;s toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we&#39;ll be there soon.&quot;<br /> <br /> And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Whatever house I&#39;m in, I hope she&#39;s not in it,&quot; said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk. &quot;Stupid spell -- George gave it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What house are your brothers in?&quot; asked Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Gryffindor,&quot; said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him again. &quot;Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;ll say if I&#39;m not. I don&#39;t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in Slytherin.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s the house Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking depressed.<br /> <br /> &quot;You know, I think the ends of Scabbers&#39; whiskers are a bit lighter,&quot; said Harry, trying to take Ron&#39;s mind off houses. &quot;So what do your oldest brothers do now that they&#39;ve left, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he&#39;d finished school.<br /> <br /> &quot;Charlie&#39;s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill&#39;s in Africa doing something for Gringotts,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Did you hear about Gringotts? It&#39;s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don&#39;t suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;Really? What happened to them?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing, that&#39;s why it&#39;s such big news. They haven&#39;t been caught. My dad says it must&#39;ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts, but they don&#39;t think they took anything, that&#39;s what&#39;s odd. &#39;Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You-Know-Who&#39;s behind it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying &quot;Voldemort&quot; without worrying.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s your Quidditch team?&quot; Ron asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -- I don&#39;t know any.&quot; Harry confessed.<br /> <br /> &quot;What!&quot; Ron looked dumbfounded. &quot;Oh, you wait, it&#39;s the best game in the world -- &quot; And he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he&#39;d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he&#39;d like to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn&#39;t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.<br /> <br /> Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin&#39;s robe shop. He was looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he&#39;d shown back in Diagon Alley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is it true?&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re saying all down the train that Harry Potter&#39;s in this compartment. So it&#39;s you, is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,&quot; said the pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. &quot;And my name&#39;s Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Think my name&#39;s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.&quot;<br /> <br /> He turned back to Harry. &quot;You&#39;ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don&#39;t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.&quot;<br /> <br /> He held out his hand to shake Harry&#39;s, but Harry didn&#39;t take it.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,&quot; he said coolly.<br /> <br /> Draco Malfoy didn&#39;t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d be careful if I were you, Potter,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Unless you&#39;re a bit politer you&#39;ll go the same way as your parents. They didn&#39;t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it&#39;ll rub off on you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Both Harry and Ron stood up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Say that again,&quot; Ron said, his face as red as his hair.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to fight us, are you?&quot; Malfoy sneered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Unless you get out now,&quot; said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;But we don&#39;t feet like leaving, do we, boys? We&#39;ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.&quot;<br /> <br /> Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron -- Ron leapt forward, but before he&#39;d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.<br /> <br /> Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep into Goyle&#39;s knuckle -- Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among the sweets, or perhaps they&#39;d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.<br /> <br /> &quot;What has been going on?&quot; she said, looking at the sweets all over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think he&#39;s been knocked out,&quot; Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. &quot;No -- I don&#39;t believe it -- he&#39;s gone back to sleep.&quot;<br /> <br /> And so he had.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve met Malfoy before?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve heard of his family,&quot; said Ron darkly. &quot;They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they&#39;d been bewitched. My dad doesn&#39;t believe it. He says Malfoy&#39;s father didn&#39;t need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side.&quot; He turned to Hermione. &quot;Can we help you with something?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better hurry up and put your robes on, I&#39;ve just been up to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we&#39;re nearly there. You haven&#39;t been fighting, have you? You&#39;ll be in trouble before we even get there!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Scabbers has been fighting, not us,&quot; said Ron, scowling at her. &quot;Would you mind leaving while we change?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,&quot; said Hermione in a sniffy voice. &quot;And you&#39;ve got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.<br /> <br /> He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black robes. Ron&#39;s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.<br /> <br /> A voice echoed through the train: &quot;We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes&#39; time. Please leave your luggage on the train, it will be taken to the school separately.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.<br /> <br /> The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice: &quot;Firs&#39; years! Firs&#39; years over here! All right there, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.<br /> <br /> &quot;C&#39;mon, follow me -- any more firs&#39; years? Mind yer step, now! Firs&#39; years follow me!&quot;<br /> <br /> Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh&#39;ll get yer firs&#39; sight o&#39; Hogwarts in a sec,&quot; Hagrid called over his shoulder, &quot;jus&#39; round this bend here.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a loud &quot;Oooooh!&quot;<br /> <br /> The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.<br /> <br /> &quot;No more&#39;n four to a boat!&quot; Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone in?&quot; shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself. &quot;Right then -- FORWARD!&quot;<br /> <br /> And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.<br /> <br /> &quot;Heads down!&quot; yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oy, you there! Is this your toad?&quot; said Hagrid, who was checking the boats as people climbed out of them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Trevor!&quot; cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid&#39;s lamp, coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.<br /> <br /> They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the huge, oak front door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the castle door.</p>"

          "id": 7,
          "title": "The Sorting Hat",
          "content": "<p> The door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry&#39;s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.<br /> <br /> &quot;The firs&#39; years, Professor McGonagall,&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.&quot;<br /> <br /> She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys&#39; house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.<br /> <br /> They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -- the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Welcome to Hogwarts,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.<br /> <br /> &quot;The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.&quot;<br /> <br /> Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville&#39;s cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron&#39;s smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.<br /> <br /> &quot;I shall return when we are ready for you,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;Please wait quietly.&quot;<br /> <br /> She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.<br /> <br /> &quot;How exactly do they sort us into houses?&quot; he asked Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn&#39;t know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn&#39;t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she&#39;d learned and wondering which one she&#39;d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He&#39;d never been more nervous, never, not even when he&#39;d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he&#39;d somehow turned his teacher&#39;s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.<br /> <br /> Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.<br /> <br /> &quot;What the -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: &quot;Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear Friar, haven&#39;t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he&#39;s not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?&quot;<br /> <br /> A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.<br /> <br /> Nobody answered.<br /> <br /> &quot;New students!&quot; said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. &quot;About to be Sorted, I suppose?&quot;<br /> <br /> A few people nodded mutely.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!&quot; said the Friar. &quot;My old house, you know.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Move along now,&quot; said a sharp voice. &quot;The Sorting Ceremony&#39;s about to start.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, form a line,&quot; Professor McGonagall told the first years, &quot;and follow me.&quot;<br /> <br /> Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.<br /> <br /> Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, &quot;Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn&#39;t simply open on to the heavens.<br /> <br /> Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard&#39;s hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn&#39;t have let it in the house.<br /> <br /> Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, you may not think I&#39;m pretty,<br /> <br /> But don&#39;t judge on what you see,<br /> <br /> I&#39;ll eat myself if you can find<br /> <br /> A smarter hat than me.<br /> <br /> You can keep your bowlers black,<br /> <br /> Your top hats sleek and tall,<br /> <br /> For I&#39;m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat<br /> <br /> And I can cap them all.<br /> <br /> There&#39;s nothing hidden in your head<br /> <br /> The Sorting Hat can&#39;t see,<br /> <br /> So try me on and I will tell you<br /> <br /> Where you ought to be.<br /> <br /> You might belong in Gryffindor,<br /> <br /> Where dwell the brave at heart,<br /> <br /> Their daring, nerve, and chivalry<br /> <br /> Set Gryffindors apart;<br /> <br /> You might belong in Hufflepuff,<br /> <br /> Where they are just and loyal,<br /> <br /> Those patient Hufflepuffs are true<br /> <br /> And unafraid of toil;<br /> <br /> Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, if you&#39;ve a ready mind,<br /> <br /> Where those of wit and learning,<br /> <br /> Will always find their kind;<br /> <br /> Or perhaps in Slytherin<br /> <br /> You&#39;ll make your real friends,<br /> <br /> Those cunning folk use any means<br /> <br /> To achieve their ends.<br /> <br /> So put me on! Don&#39;t be afraid!<br /> <br /> And don&#39;t get in a flap!<br /> <br /> You&#39;re in safe hands (though I have none)<br /> <br /> For I&#39;m a Thinking Cap!&quot;<br /> <br /> The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.<br /> <br /> &quot;So we&#39;ve just got to try on the hat!&quot; Ron whispered to Harry. &quot;I&#39;ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn&#39;t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.<br /> <br /> &quot;When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,&quot; she said. &quot;Abbott, Hannah!&quot;<br /> <br /> A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause --<br /> <br /> &quot;HUFFLEPUFF!&quot; shouted the hat.<br /> <br /> The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bones, Susan!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;HUFFLEPUFF!&quot; shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.<br /> <br /> &quot;Boot, Terry!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;RAVENCLAW!&quot;<br /> <br /> The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Brocklehurst, Mandy&quot; went to Ravenclaw too, but &quot;Brown, Lavender&quot; became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron&#39;s twin brothers catcalling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bulstrode, Millicent&quot; then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry&#39;s imagination, after all he&#39;d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.<br /> <br /> He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Finch-Fletchley, Justin!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;HUFFLEPUFF!&quot;<br /> <br /> Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. &quot;Finnigan, Seamus,&quot; the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Granger, Hermione!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.<br /> <br /> &quot;GRYFFINDOR!&quot; shouted the hat. Ron groaned.<br /> <br /> A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you&#39;re very nervous. What if he wasn&#39;t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he&#39;d better get back on the train?<br /> <br /> When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, &quot;GRYFFINDOR,&quot; Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to &quot;MacDougal, Morag.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, &quot;SLYTHERIN!&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.<br /> <br /> There weren&#39;t many people left now. &quot;Moon&quot;..., &quot;Nott&quot;..., &quot;Parkinson&quot;..., then a pair of twin girls, &quot;Patil&quot; and &quot;Patil&quot;..., then &quot;Perks, Sally-Anne&quot;..., and then, at last --<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, did she say?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The Harry Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hmm,&quot; said a small voice in his ear. &quot;Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There&#39;s talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that&#39;s interesting... So where shall I put you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not Slytherin, eh?&quot; said the small voice. &quot;Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it&#39;s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you&#39;re sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, &quot;We got Potter! We got Potter!&quot; Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he&#39;d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he&#39;d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.<br /> <br /> He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he&#39;d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore&#39;s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.<br /> <br /> And now there were only three people left to be sorted. &quot;Thomas, Dean,&quot; a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. &quot;Turpin, Lisa,&quot; became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron&#39;s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, &quot;GRYFFINDOR!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well done, Ron, excellent,&quot; said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as &quot;Zabini, Blaise,&quot; was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.<br /> <br /> Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.<br /> <br /> Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.<br /> <br /> &quot;Welcome,&quot; he said. &quot;Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank you!&quot;<br /> <br /> He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or not.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is he -- a bit mad?&quot; he asked Percy uncertainly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mad?&quot; said Percy airily. &quot;He&#39;s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.<br /> <br /> The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he&#39;d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.<br /> <br /> &quot;That does look good,&quot; said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t you -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I haven&#39;t eaten for nearly five hundred years,&quot; said the ghost. &quot;I don&#39;t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know who you are!&quot; said Ron suddenly. &quot;My brothers told me about you -- you&#39;re Nearly Headless Nick!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy -- &quot; the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?&quot;<br /> <br /> Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn&#39;t going at all the way he wanted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Like this,&quot; he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, &quot;So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you&#39;re going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron&#39;s becoming almost unbearable -- he&#39;s the Slytherin ghost.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn&#39;t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.<br /> <br /> &quot;How did he get covered in blood?&quot; asked Seamus with great interest.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve never asked,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.<br /> <br /> When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding...<br /> <br /> As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m half-and-half,&quot; said Seamus. &quot;Me dad&#39;s a Muggle. Mom didn&#39;t tell him she was a witch &#39;til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.&quot;<br /> <br /> The others laughed.<br /> <br /> &quot;What about you, Neville?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, my gran brought me up and she&#39;s a witch,&quot; said Neville, &quot;but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.&quot;<br /> <br /> On Harry&#39;s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (&quot;I do hope they start right away, there&#39;s so much to learn, I&#39;m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it&#39;s supposed to be very difficult -- &quot;; &quot;You&#39;ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- &quot;).<br /> <br /> Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.<br /> <br /> It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell&#39;s turban straight into Harry&#39;s eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry&#39;s forehead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ouch!&quot; Harry clapped a hand to his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;What is it?&quot; asked Percy.<br /> <br /> &quot;N-nothing.&quot;<br /> <br /> The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher&#39;s look -- a feeling that he didn&#39;t like Harry at all.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?&quot; he asked Percy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he&#39;s looking so nervous, that&#39;s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn&#39;t want to -- everyone knows he&#39;s after Quirrell&#39;s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn&#39;t look at him again.<br /> <br /> At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ahem -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.<br /> <br /> &quot;First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore&#39;s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.<br /> <br /> &quot;I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.<br /> <br /> &quot;Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.<br /> <br /> &quot;And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s not serious?&quot; he muttered to Percy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Must be,&quot; said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. &quot;It&#39;s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we&#39;re not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest&#39;s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!&quot; cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers&#39; smiles had become rather fixed.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone pick their favorite tune,&quot; said Dumbledore, &quot;and off we go!&quot;<br /> <br /> And the school bellowed:<br /> <br /> &quot;Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,<br /> <br /> Teach us something please,<br /> <br /> Whether we be old and bald<br /> <br /> Or young with scabby knees,<br /> <br /> Our heads could do with filling<br /> <br /> With some interesting stuff,<br /> <br /> For now they&#39;re bare and full of air,<br /> <br /> Dead flies and bits of fluff,<br /> <br /> So teach us things worth knowing,<br /> <br /> Bring back what we&#39;ve forgot, just do your best, we&#39;ll do the rest,<br /> <br /> And learn until our brains all rot.&quot;<br /> <br /> Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, music,&quot; he said, wiping his eyes. &quot;A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!&quot;<br /> <br /> The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry&#39;s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.<br /> <br /> A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Peeves,&quot; Percy whispered to the first years. &quot;A poltergeist.&quot; He raised his voice, &quot;Peeves -- show yourself.&quot;<br /> <br /> A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oooooooh!&quot; he said, with an evil cackle. &quot;Ickle Firsties! What fun!&quot;<br /> <br /> He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go away, Peeves, or the Baron&#39;ll hear about this, I mean it!&quot; barked Percy.<br /> <br /> Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville&#39;s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.<br /> <br /> &quot;You want to watch out for Peeves,&quot; said Percy, as they set off again. &quot;The Bloody Baron&#39;s the only one who can control him, he won&#39;t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.&quot;<br /> <br /> At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.<br /> <br /> &quot;Password?&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Caput Draconis,&quot; said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.<br /> <br /> Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Great food, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. &quot;Get off, Scabbers! He&#39;s chewing my sheets.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was going to ask Ron if he&#39;d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.<br /> <br /> Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell&#39;s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn&#39;t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -- then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.<br /> <br /> He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn&#39;t remember the dream at all.</p> "

          "id": 8,
          "title": "The Potions Master",
          "content": "<p> &quot;There, look.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Where?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Next to the tall kid with the red hair.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wearing the glasses?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you see his face?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you see his scar?&quot;<br /> <br /> Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tiptoe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn&#39;t, because he was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.<br /> <br /> There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that wouldn&#39;t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly the right place, and doors that weren&#39;t really doors at all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where anything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure the coats of armor could walk.<br /> <br /> The ghosts didn&#39;t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, &quot;GOT YOUR CONK!&quot;<br /> <br /> Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He wouldn&#39;t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.<br /> <br /> Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored creature with bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch&#39;s. She patrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out of line, and she&#39;d whisk off for Filch, who&#39;d appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him, and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.<br /> <br /> And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words.<br /> <br /> They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for. Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.<br /> <br /> Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry&#39;s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right to think she wasn&#39;t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.<br /> <br /> &quot;Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.&quot;<br /> <br /> Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn&#39;t wait to get started, but soon realized they weren&#39;t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.<br /> <br /> The class everyone had really been looking forward to was Defense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell&#39;s lessons turned out to be a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he&#39;d met in Romania and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they weren&#39;t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.<br /> <br /> Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn&#39;t miles behind everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, like him, hadn&#39;t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn&#39;t have much of a head start.<br /> <br /> Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast without getting lost once.<br /> <br /> &quot;What have we got today?&quot; Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar on his porridge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Double Potions with the Slytherins,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Snape&#39;s Head of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them -- we&#39;ll be able to see if it&#39;s true.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wish McGonagall favored us,&quot; said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn&#39;t stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.<br /> <br /> Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.<br /> <br /> Hedwig hadn&#39;t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto Harry&#39;s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:<br /> <br /> Dear Harry,<br /> <br /> I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?<br /> <br /> I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig.<br /> <br /> Hagrid<br /> <br /> Harry borrowed Ron&#39;s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again.<br /> <br /> It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far.<br /> <br /> At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, he knew he&#39;d been wrong. Snape didn&#39;t dislike Harry -- he hated him.<br /> <br /> Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all around the walls.<br /> <br /> Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused at Harry&#39;s name.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, Yes,&quot; he said softly, &quot;Harry Potter. Our new -- celebrity.&quot;<br /> <br /> Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid&#39;s, but they had none of Hagrid&#39;s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnels.<br /> <br /> &quot;You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking,&quot; he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but they caught every word -- like Professor McGonagall, Snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. &quot;As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don&#39;t expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death -- if you aren&#39;t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.&quot;<br /> <br /> More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wasn&#39;t a dunderhead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter!&quot; said Snape suddenly. &quot;What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?&quot;<br /> <br /> Powdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione&#39;s hand had shot into the air.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know, sir,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Snape&#39;s lips curled into a sneer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Tut, tut -- fame clearly isn&#39;t everything.&quot;<br /> <br /> He ignored Hermione&#39;s hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn&#39;t have the faintest idea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Thought you wouldn&#39;t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?&quot; Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys&#39;, but did Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi ?<br /> <br /> Snape was still ignoring Hermione&#39;s quivering hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?&quot;<br /> <br /> At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Harry quietly. &quot;I think Hermione does, though, why don&#39;t you try her?&quot;<br /> <br /> A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus&#39;s eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sit down,&quot; he snapped at Hermione. &quot;For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren&#39;t you all copying that down?&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over the noise, Snape said, &quot;And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek, Potter.&quot;<br /> <br /> Things didn&#39;t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed to melt Seamus&#39;s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people&#39;s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Idiot boy!&quot; snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand. &quot;I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire?&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Take him up to the hospital wing,&quot; Snape spat at Seamus. Then he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to Neville.<br /> <br /> &quot;You -- Potter -- why didn&#39;t you tell him not to add the quills? Thought he&#39;d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That&#39;s another point you&#39;ve lost for Gryffindor.&quot;<br /> <br /> This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t push it,&quot; he muttered, &quot;I&#39;ve heard Snape can turn very nasty.&quot;<br /> <br /> As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, Harry&#39;s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He&#39;d lost two points for Gryffindor in his very first week -- why did Snape hate him so much?<br /> <br /> &quot;Cheer up,&quot; said Ron, &quot;Snape&#39;s always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?&quot;<br /> <br /> At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside the front door.<br /> <br /> When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid&#39;s voice rang out, saying, &quot;Back, Fang -- back.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the door open.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hang on,&quot; he said. &quot;Back, Fang.&quot;<br /> <br /> He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound.<br /> <br /> There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Make yerselves at home,&quot; said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is Ron,&quot; Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.<br /> <br /> &quot;Another Weasley, eh?&quot; said Hagrid, glancing at Ron&#39;s freckles. I spent half me life chasin&#39; yer twin brothers away from the forest.&quot;<br /> <br /> The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry&#39;s knee and drooled all over his robes.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch &quot;that old git.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;An&#39; as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I&#39;d like ter introduce her to Fang sometime. D&#39;yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she follows me everywhere? Can&#39;t get rid of her -- Filch puts her up to it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry told Hagrid about Snape&#39;s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the students.<br /> <br /> &quot;But he seemed to really hate me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubbish!&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Why should he?&quot;<br /> <br /> Yet Harry couldn&#39;t help thinking that Hagrid didn&#39;t quite meet his eyes when he said that.<br /> <br /> &quot;How&#39;s yer brother Charlie?&quot; Hagrid asked Ron. &quot;I liked him a lot -- great with animals.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie&#39;s work with dragons, Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet :<br /> <br /> GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST<br /> <br /> Investigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.<br /> <br /> Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied the same day.<br /> <br /> &quot;But we&#39;re not telling you what was in there, so keep your noses out if you know what&#39;s good for you,&quot; said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.<br /> <br /> Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn&#39;t mentioned the date.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot; said Harry, &quot;that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday! It might&#39;ve been happening while we were there!&quot;<br /> <br /> There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn&#39;t meet Harry&#39;s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?<br /> <br /> As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their pockets weighed down with rock cakes they&#39;d been too polite to refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he&#39;d had so far had given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn&#39;t want to tell Harry?</p> "

          "title": "The Midnight Duel",
          "content": "<p> Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn&#39;t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn&#39;t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.<br /> <br /> &quot;Typical,&quot; said Harry darkly. &quot;Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.&quot;<br /> <br /> He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t know that you&#39;ll make a fool of yourself,&quot; said Ron reasonably. &quot;Anyway, I know Malfoy&#39;s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that&#39;s all talk.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn&#39;t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he&#39;d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who&#39;d listen about the time he&#39;d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie&#39;s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn&#39;t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean&#39;s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.<br /> <br /> Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she&#39;d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.<br /> <br /> Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn&#39;t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn&#39;t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she&#39;d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione&#39;s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.<br /> <br /> Harry hadn&#39;t had a single letter since Hagrid&#39;s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy&#39;s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.<br /> <br /> A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a Remembrall!&quot; he explained. &quot;Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there&#39;s something you&#39;ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh... &quot; His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, &quot;... you&#39;ve forgotten something...&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville was trying to remember what he&#39;d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy&#39;s got my Remembrall, Professor.&quot;<br /> <br /> Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just looking,&quot; he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.<br /> <br /> At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.<br /> <br /> The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.<br /> <br /> Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, what are you all waiting for?&quot; she barked. &quot;Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stick out your right hand over your broom,&quot; called Madam Hooch at the front, &quot;and say &#39;Up!&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;UP&quot; everyone shouted.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger&#39;s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville&#39;s hadn&#39;t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville&#39;s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he&#39;d been doing it wrong for years.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,&quot; said Madam Hooch. &quot;Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch&#39;s lips.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come back, boy!&quot; she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --<br /> <br /> WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.<br /> <br /> &quot;Broken wrist,&quot; Harry heard her mutter. &quot;Come on, boy -- it&#39;s all right, up you get.&quot;<br /> <br /> She turned to the rest of the class.<br /> <br /> &quot;None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you&#39;ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say &#39;Quidditch.&#39; Come on, dear.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.<br /> <br /> No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you see his face, the great lump?&quot;<br /> <br /> The other Slytherins joined in.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, Malfoy,&quot; snapped Parvati Patil.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?&quot; said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. &quot;Never thought you&#39;d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look!&quot; said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. &quot;It&#39;s that stupid thing Longbottom&#39;s gran sent him.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give that here, Malfoy,&quot; said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.<br /> <br /> Malfoy smiled nastily.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I&#39;ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Give it here!&quot; Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn&#39;t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, &quot;Come and get it, Potter!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry grabbed his broom.<br /> <br /> &quot;No!&quot; shouted Hermione Granger. &quot;Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you&#39;ll get us all into trouble.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he&#39;d found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.<br /> <br /> He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give it here,&quot; Harry called, &quot;or I&#39;ll knock you off that broom!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.<br /> <br /> Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.<br /> <br /> &quot;No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,&quot; Harry called.<br /> <br /> The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Catch it if you can, then!&quot; he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.<br /> <br /> Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.<br /> <br /> &quot;HARRY POTTER!&quot;<br /> <br /> His heart sank faster than he&#39;d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts--&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, &quot; -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It wasn&#39;t his fault, Professor--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Be quiet, Miss Patil--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But Malfoy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&#39;s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall&#39;s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he&#39;d done it. He hadn&#39;t even lasted two weeks. He&#39;d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?<br /> <br /> Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn&#39;t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid&#39;s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid&#39;s bag.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?<br /> <br /> But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick&#39;s class looking confused.<br /> <br /> &quot;Follow me, you two,&quot; said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;In here.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Out, Peeves!&quot; she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I&#39;ve found you a Seeker.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood&#39;s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you serious, Professor?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Professor McGonagall crisply. &quot;The boy&#39;s a natural. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nodded silently. He didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on, but he didn&#39;t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.<br /> <br /> &quot;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,&quot; Professor McGonagall told Wood. &quot;Didn&#39;t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn&#39;t have done it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?&quot; he asked excitedly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wood&#39;s captain of the Gryffindor team,&quot; Professor McGonagall explained.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s just the build for a Seeker, too,&quot; said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. &quot;Light -- speedy -- we&#39;ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I&#39;d say.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can&#39;t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn&#39;t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to hear you&#39;re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Then she suddenly smiled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Your father would have been proud,&quot; she said. &quot;He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he&#39;d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he&#39;d forgotten all about it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Seeker ?&quot; he said. &quot;But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;-- a century,&quot; said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. &quot;Wood told me.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I start training next week,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Only don&#39;t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well done,&quot; said George in a low voice. &quot;Wood told us. We&#39;re on the team too -- Beaters.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I tell you, we&#39;re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,&quot; said Fred. &quot;We haven&#39;t won since Charlie left, but this year&#39;s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Anyway, we&#39;ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he&#39;s found a new secret passageway out of the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet it&#39;s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re a lot braver now that you&#39;re back on the ground and you&#39;ve got your little friends with you,&quot; said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d take you on anytime on my own,&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;Tonight, if you want. Wizard&#39;s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What&#39;s the matter? Never heard of a wizard&#39;s duel before, I suppose?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course he has,&quot; said Ron, wheeling around. &quot;I&#39;m his second, who&#39;s yours?&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Crabbe,&quot; he said. &quot;Midnight all right? We&#39;ll meet you in the trophy room; that&#39;s always unlocked.&quot;<br /> <br /> When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;What is a wizard&#39;s duel?&quot; said Harry. &quot;And what do you mean, you&#39;re my second?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, a second&#39;s there to take over if you die,&quot; said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry&#39;s face, he added quickly, &quot;But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy&#39;ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Throw it away and punch him on the nose,&quot; Ron suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br /> <br /> They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t a person eat in peace in this place?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I couldn&#39;t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet you could,&quot; Ron muttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;-- and you mustn&#39;t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you&#39;ll lose Gryffindor if you&#39;re caught, and you&#39;re bound to be. It&#39;s really very selfish of you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And it&#39;s really none of your business,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> All the same, it wasn&#39;t what you&#39;d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn&#39;t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as &quot;If he tries to curse you, you&#39;d better dodge it, because I can&#39;t remember how to block them.&quot; There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy&#39;s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness -- this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn&#39;t miss it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Half-past eleven,&quot; Ron muttered at last, &quot;we&#39;d better go.&quot;<br /> <br /> They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re going to do this, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.<br /> <br /> &quot;You!&quot; said Ron furiously. &quot;Go back to bed!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I almost told your brother,&quot; Hermione snapped, &quot;Percy -- he&#39;s a prefect, he&#39;d put a stop to this.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t believe anyone could be so interfering.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.<br /> <br /> Hermione wasn&#39;t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don&#39;t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you&#39;ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go away.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you&#39;re on the train home tomorrow, you&#39;re so--&quot;<br /> <br /> But what they were, they didn&#39;t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what am I going to do?&quot; she asked shrilly.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s your problem,&quot; said Ron. &quot;We&#39;ve got to go, we&#39;re going to be late.&quot;<br /> <br /> They hadn&#39;t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;You are not.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think I&#39;m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I&#39;ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve got some nerve -- &quot; said Ron loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, both of you!&quot; said Harry sharply. I heard something.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was a sort of snuffling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mrs. Norris?&quot; breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank goodness you found me! I&#39;ve been out here for hours, I couldn&#39;t remember the new password to get in to bed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Keep your voice down, Neville. The password&#39;s &#39;Pig snout&#39; but it won&#39;t help you now, the Fat Lady&#39;s gone off somewhere.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How&#39;s your arm?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fine,&quot; said Neville, showing them. &quot;Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good -- well, look, Neville, we&#39;ve got to be somewhere, we&#39;ll see you later--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t leave me!&quot; said Neville, scrambling to his feet, &quot;I don&#39;t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron&#39;s been past twice already.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.<br /> <br /> &quot;If either of you get us caught, I&#39;ll never rest until I&#39;ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.<br /> <br /> They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.<br /> <br /> Malfoy and Crabbe weren&#39;t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s late, maybe he&#39;s chickened out,&quot; Ron whispered.<br /> <br /> Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -- and it wasn&#39;t Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch&#39;s voice. Neville&#39;s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;re in here somewhere,&quot; they heard him mutter, &quot;probably hiding.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This way!&quot; Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.<br /> <br /> The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.<br /> <br /> &quot;RUN!&quot; Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think we&#39;ve lost him,&quot; Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.<br /> <br /> &quot;I -- told -- you,&quot; Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, &quot;I -- told -- you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,&quot; said Ron, &quot;quickly as possible.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy tricked you,&quot; Hermione said to Harry. &quot;You realize that, don&#39;t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn&#39;t going to tell her that.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t going to be that simple. They hadn&#39;t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.<br /> <br /> It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you&#39;ll get us thrown out.&quot;<br /> <br /> Peeves cackled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you&#39;ll get caughty.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not if you don&#39;t give us away, Peeves, please.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Should tell Filch, I should,&quot; said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. &quot;It&#39;s for your own good, you know.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Get out of the way,&quot; snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.<br /> <br /> &quot;STUDENTS OUT OF BED!&quot; Peeves bellowed, &quot;STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is it!&quot; Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, &quot;We&#39;re done for! This is the end!&quot;<br /> <br /> They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves&#39;s shouts.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, move over,&quot; Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry&#39;s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, &quot;Alohomora!&quot;<br /> <br /> The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Which way did they go, Peeves?&quot; Filch was saying. &quot;Quick, tell me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Say &#39;please.&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shan&#39;t say nothing if you don&#39;t say please,&quot; said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right -- please.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn&#39;t say nothing if you didn&#39;t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!&quot; And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.<br /> <br /> &quot;He thinks this door is locked,&quot; Harry whispered. &quot;I think we&#39;ll be okay -- get off, Neville!&quot; For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry&#39;s bathrobe for the last minute. &quot;What ?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he&#39;d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.<br /> <br /> They weren&#39;t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.<br /> <br /> They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.<br /> <br /> It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren&#39;t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.<br /> <br /> Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he&#39;d take Filch.<br /> <br /> They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn&#39;t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn&#39;t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where on earth have you all been?&quot; she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,&quot; panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.<br /> <br /> It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he&#39;d never speak again.<br /> <br /> &quot;What do they think they&#39;re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?&quot; said Ron finally. &quot;If any dog needs exercise, that one does.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. &quot;You don&#39;t use your eyes, any of you, do you?&quot; she snapped. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see what it was standing on.<br /> <br /> &quot;The floor?&quot; Harry suggested. &quot;I wasn&#39;t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It&#39;s obviously guarding something.&quot;<br /> <br /> She stood up, glaring at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I hope you&#39;re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron stared after her, his mouth open.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, we don&#39;t mind,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;d think we dragged her along, wouldn&#39;t you.<br /> <br /> But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.<br /> <br /> It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</p> "

          "title": "Halloween",
          "content": "<p> Harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn&#39;t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn&#39;t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.<br /> <br /> &quot;Typical,&quot; said Harry darkly. &quot;Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.&quot;<br /> <br /> He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t know that you&#39;ll make a fool of yourself,&quot; said Ron reasonably. &quot;Anyway, I know Malfoy&#39;s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that&#39;s all talk.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn&#39;t the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he&#39;d spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who&#39;d listen about the time he&#39;d almost hit a hang glider on Charlie&#39;s old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn&#39;t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean&#39;s poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.<br /> <br /> Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she&#39;d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.<br /> <br /> Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn&#39;t learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn&#39;t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she&#39;d gotten out of a library book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione&#39;s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.<br /> <br /> Harry hadn&#39;t had a single letter since Hagrid&#39;s note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy&#39;s eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.<br /> <br /> A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a Remembrall!&quot; he explained. &quot;Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there&#39;s something you&#39;ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh... &quot; His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, &quot;... you&#39;ve forgotten something...&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville was trying to remember what he&#39;d forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a flash.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy&#39;s got my Remembrall, Professor.&quot;<br /> <br /> Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just looking,&quot; he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and Goyle behind him.<br /> <br /> At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.<br /> <br /> The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.<br /> <br /> Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, what are you all waiting for?&quot; she barked. &quot;Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stick out your right hand over your broom,&quot; called Madam Hooch at the front, &quot;and say &#39;Up!&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;UP&quot; everyone shouted.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger&#39;s had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville&#39;s hadn&#39;t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville&#39;s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he&#39;d been doing it wrong for years.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,&quot; said Madam Hooch. &quot;Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch&#39;s lips.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come back, boy!&quot; she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --<br /> <br /> WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his.<br /> <br /> &quot;Broken wrist,&quot; Harry heard her mutter. &quot;Come on, boy -- it&#39;s all right, up you get.&quot;<br /> <br /> She turned to the rest of the class.<br /> <br /> &quot;None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you&#39;ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say &#39;Quidditch.&#39; Come on, dear.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.<br /> <br /> No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you see his face, the great lump?&quot;<br /> <br /> The other Slytherins joined in.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, Malfoy,&quot; snapped Parvati Patil.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?&quot; said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. &quot;Never thought you&#39;d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look!&quot; said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. &quot;It&#39;s that stupid thing Longbottom&#39;s gran sent him.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give that here, Malfoy,&quot; said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.<br /> <br /> Malfoy smiled nastily.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I&#39;ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Give it here!&quot; Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn&#39;t been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, &quot;Come and get it, Potter!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry grabbed his broom.<br /> <br /> &quot;No!&quot; shouted Hermione Granger. &quot;Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you&#39;ll get us all into trouble.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he&#39;d found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.<br /> <br /> He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Malfoy looked stunned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give it here,&quot; Harry called, &quot;or I&#39;ll knock you off that broom!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.<br /> <br /> Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.<br /> <br /> &quot;No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,&quot; Harry called.<br /> <br /> The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Catch it if you can, then!&quot; he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.<br /> <br /> Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.<br /> <br /> &quot;HARRY POTTER!&quot;<br /> <br /> His heart sank faster than he&#39;d just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts--&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, &quot; -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It wasn&#39;t his fault, Professor--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Be quiet, Miss Patil--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But Malfoy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle&#39;s triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall&#39;s wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he&#39;d done it. He hadn&#39;t even lasted two weeks. He&#39;d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?<br /> <br /> Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn&#39;t say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid&#39;s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards, while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid&#39;s bag.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him?<br /> <br /> But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick&#39;s class looking confused.<br /> <br /> &quot;Follow me, you two,&quot; said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;In here.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Out, Peeves!&quot; she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I&#39;ve found you a Seeker.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood&#39;s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you serious, Professor?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Absolutely,&quot; said Professor McGonagall crisply. &quot;The boy&#39;s a natural. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nodded silently. He didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on, but he didn&#39;t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.<br /> <br /> &quot;He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,&quot; Professor McGonagall told Wood. &quot;Didn&#39;t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn&#39;t have done it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?&quot; he asked excitedly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wood&#39;s captain of the Gryffindor team,&quot; Professor McGonagall explained.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s just the build for a Seeker, too,&quot; said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring at him. &quot;Light -- speedy -- we&#39;ll have to get him a decent broom, Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven, I&#39;d say.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can&#39;t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn&#39;t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks...&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to hear you&#39;re training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind about punishing you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Then she suddenly smiled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Your father would have been proud,&quot; she said. &quot;He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re joking.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he&#39;d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but he&#39;d forgotten all about it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Seeker ?&quot; he said. &quot;But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;-- a century,&quot; said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. &quot;Wood told me.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I start training next week,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Only don&#39;t tell anyone, Wood wants to keep it a secret.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well done,&quot; said George in a low voice. &quot;Wood told us. We&#39;re on the team too -- Beaters.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I tell you, we&#39;re going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year,&quot; said Fred. &quot;We haven&#39;t won since Charlie left, but this year&#39;s team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Anyway, we&#39;ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he&#39;s found a new secret passageway out of the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet it&#39;s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week. See you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re a lot braver now that you&#39;re back on the ground and you&#39;ve got your little friends with you,&quot; said Harry coolly. There was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d take you on anytime on my own,&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;Tonight, if you want. Wizard&#39;s duel. Wands only -- no contact. What&#39;s the matter? Never heard of a wizard&#39;s duel before, I suppose?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course he has,&quot; said Ron, wheeling around. &quot;I&#39;m his second, who&#39;s yours?&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Crabbe,&quot; he said. &quot;Midnight all right? We&#39;ll meet you in the trophy room; that&#39;s always unlocked.&quot;<br /> <br /> When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;What is a wizard&#39;s duel?&quot; said Harry. &quot;And what do you mean, you&#39;re my second?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, a second&#39;s there to take over if you die,&quot; said Ron casually, getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry&#39;s face, he added quickly, &quot;But people only die in proper duels, you know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy&#39;ll be able to do is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Throw it away and punch him on the nose,&quot; Ron suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me.&quot;<br /> <br /> They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t a person eat in peace in this place?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I couldn&#39;t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet you could,&quot; Ron muttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;-- and you mustn&#39;t go wandering around the school at night, think of the points you&#39;ll lose Gryffindor if you&#39;re caught, and you&#39;re bound to be. It&#39;s really very selfish of you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And it&#39;s really none of your business,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good-bye,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> All the same, it wasn&#39;t what you&#39;d call the perfect end to the day, Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn&#39;t back from the hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as &quot;If he tries to curse you, you&#39;d better dodge it, because I can&#39;t remember how to block them.&quot; There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy&#39;s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness -- this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn&#39;t miss it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Half-past eleven,&quot; Ron muttered at last, &quot;we&#39;d better go.&quot;<br /> <br /> They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re going to do this, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown.<br /> <br /> &quot;You!&quot; said Ron furiously. &quot;Go back to bed!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I almost told your brother,&quot; Hermione snapped, &quot;Percy -- he&#39;s a prefect, he&#39;d put a stop to this.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t believe anyone could be so interfering.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.<br /> <br /> Hermione wasn&#39;t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about yourselves, I don&#39;t want Slytherin to win the house cup, and you&#39;ll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go away.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you&#39;re on the train home tomorrow, you&#39;re so--&quot;<br /> <br /> But what they were, they didn&#39;t find out. Hermione had turned to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor tower.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what am I going to do?&quot; she asked shrilly.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s your problem,&quot; said Ron. &quot;We&#39;ve got to go, we&#39;re going to be late.&quot;<br /> <br /> They hadn&#39;t even reached the end of the corridor when Hermione caught up with them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;You are not.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think I&#39;m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I&#39;ll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you, and you can back me up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve got some nerve -- &quot; said Ron loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, both of you!&quot; said Harry sharply. I heard something.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was a sort of snuffling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mrs. Norris?&quot; breathed Ron, squinting through the dark.<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank goodness you found me! I&#39;ve been out here for hours, I couldn&#39;t remember the new password to get in to bed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Keep your voice down, Neville. The password&#39;s &#39;Pig snout&#39; but it won&#39;t help you now, the Fat Lady&#39;s gone off somewhere.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How&#39;s your arm?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fine,&quot; said Neville, showing them. &quot;Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good -- well, look, Neville, we&#39;ve got to be somewhere, we&#39;ll see you later--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t leave me!&quot; said Neville, scrambling to his feet, &quot;I don&#39;t want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron&#39;s been past twice already.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione and Neville.<br /> <br /> &quot;If either of you get us caught, I&#39;ll never rest until I&#39;ve learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward.<br /> <br /> They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.<br /> <br /> Malfoy and Crabbe weren&#39;t there yet. The crystal trophy cases glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and started at once. The minutes crept by.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s late, maybe he&#39;s chickened out,&quot; Ron whispered.<br /> <br /> Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak -- and it wasn&#39;t Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible; they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch&#39;s voice. Neville&#39;s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they heard Filch enter the trophy room.<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;re in here somewhere,&quot; they heard him mutter, &quot;probably hiding.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This way!&quot; Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped, grabbed Ron around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor.<br /> <br /> The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.<br /> <br /> &quot;RUN!&quot; Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think we&#39;ve lost him,&quot; Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.<br /> <br /> &quot;I -- told -- you,&quot; Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her chest, &quot;I -- told -- you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got to get back to Gryffindor tower,&quot; said Ron, &quot;quickly as possible.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy tricked you,&quot; Hermione said to Harry. &quot;You realize that, don&#39;t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn&#39;t going to tell her that.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t going to be that simple. They hadn&#39;t gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them.<br /> <br /> It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, Peeves -- please -- you&#39;ll get us thrown out.&quot;<br /> <br /> Peeves cackled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you&#39;ll get caughty.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not if you don&#39;t give us away, Peeves, please.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Should tell Filch, I should,&quot; said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. &quot;It&#39;s for your own good, you know.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Get out of the way,&quot; snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves this was a big mistake.<br /> <br /> &quot;STUDENTS OUT OF BED!&quot; Peeves bellowed, &quot;STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door -- and it was locked.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is it!&quot; Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, &quot;We&#39;re done for! This is the end!&quot;<br /> <br /> They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could toward Peeves&#39;s shouts.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, move over,&quot; Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry&#39;s wand, tapped the lock, and whispered, &quot;Alohomora!&quot;<br /> <br /> The lock clicked and the door swung open -- they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Which way did they go, Peeves?&quot; Filch was saying. &quot;Quick, tell me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Say &#39;please.&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shan&#39;t say nothing if you don&#39;t say please,&quot; said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right -- please.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn&#39;t say nothing if you didn&#39;t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!&quot; And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.<br /> <br /> &quot;He thinks this door is locked,&quot; Harry whispered. &quot;I think we&#39;ll be okay -- get off, Neville!&quot; For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry&#39;s bathrobe for the last minute. &quot;What ?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry turned around -- and saw, quite clearly, what. For a moment, he was sure he&#39;d walked into a nightmare -- this was too much, on top of everything that had happened so far.<br /> <br /> They weren&#39;t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a corridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.<br /> <br /> They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.<br /> <br /> It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren&#39;t already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.<br /> <br /> Harry groped for the doorknob -- between Filch and death, he&#39;d take Filch.<br /> <br /> They fell backward -- Harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn&#39;t see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn&#39;t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where on earth have you all been?&quot; she asked, looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;Never mind that -- pig snout, pig snout,&quot; panted Harry, and the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs.<br /> <br /> It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked as if he&#39;d never speak again.<br /> <br /> &quot;What do they think they&#39;re doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?&quot; said Ron finally. &quot;If any dog needs exercise, that one does.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. &quot;You don&#39;t use your eyes, any of you, do you?&quot; she snapped. &quot;Didn&#39;t you see what it was standing on.<br /> <br /> &quot;The floor?&quot; Harry suggested. &quot;I wasn&#39;t looking at its feet, I was too busy with its heads.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It&#39;s obviously guarding something.&quot;<br /> <br /> She stood up, glaring at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I hope you&#39;re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed -- or worse, expelled. Now, if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m going to bed.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron stared after her, his mouth open.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, we don&#39;t mind,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;d think we dragged her along, wouldn&#39;t you.<br /> <br /> But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something... What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide -- except perhaps Hogwarts.<br /> <br /> It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.</p> "

          "id": 11,
          "title": "Quidditch",
          "content": "<p> As they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The mountains around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.<br /> <br /> The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second place in the house championship.<br /> <br /> Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn&#39;t know which was worse -- people telling him he&#39;d be brilliant or people telling him they&#39;d be running around underneath him holding a mattress.<br /> <br /> It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He didn&#39;t know how he&#39;d have gotten through all his homework without her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read.<br /> <br /> Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the Sahara Desert.<br /> <br /> Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry&#39;s first Quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it wouldn&#39;t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty faces caught Snape&#39;s eye. He limped over. He hadn&#39;t seen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got there, Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Library books are not to be taken outside the school,&quot; said Snape. &quot;Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s just made that rule up,&quot; Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped away. &quot;Wonder what&#39;s wrong with his leg?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno, but I hope it&#39;s really hurting him,&quot; said Ron bitterly.<br /> <br /> The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron&#39;s Charms homework for them. She would never let them copy (&quot;How will you learn?&quot;), but by asking her to read it through, they got the right answers anyway.<br /> <br /> Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back, to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going to ask Snape if he could have it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Better you than me,&quot; they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn&#39;t refuse if there were other teachers listening.<br /> <br /> He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.<br /> <br /> Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He pushed the door ajar and peered inside - and a horrible scene met his eyes.<br /> <br /> Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.<br /> <br /> &quot;Blasted thing,&quot; Snape was saying. &quot;How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but --<br /> <br /> &quot;POTTER!&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape&#39;s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.<br /> <br /> &quot;I just wondered if I could have my book back.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;GET OUT! OUT!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you get it?&quot; Ron asked as Harry joined them. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br /> <br /> In a low whisper, Harry told them what he&#39;d seen.<br /> <br /> &quot;You know what this means?&quot; he finished breathlessly. &quot;He tried to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That&#39;s where he was going when we saw him -- he&#39;s after whatever it&#39;s guarding! And I&#39;d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione&#39;s eyes were wide.<br /> <br /> &quot;No -- he wouldn&#39;t, she said. &quot;I know he&#39;s not very nice, but he wouldn&#39;t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,&quot; snapped Ron. &quot;I&#39;m with Harry. I wouldn&#39;t put anything past Snape. But what&#39;s he after? What&#39;s that dog guarding?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn&#39;t sleep. He tried to empty his mind -- he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match in a few hours - but the expression on Snape&#39;s face when Harry had seen his leg wasn&#39;t easy to forget.<br /> <br /> The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve got to eat some breakfast.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t want anything.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just a bit of toast,&quot; wheedled Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not hungry.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt terrible. In an hour&#39;s time he&#39;d be walking onto the field.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, you need your strength,&quot; said Seamus Finnigan. &quot;Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Thanks, Seamus,&quot; said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on his sausages.<br /> <br /> By eleven o&#39;clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes.<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing in green).<br /> <br /> Wood cleared his throat for silence.<br /> <br /> &quot;Okay, men,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;And women,&quot; said Chaser Angelina Johnson.<br /> <br /> &quot;And women,&quot; Wood agreed. &quot;This is it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The big one,&quot; said Fred Weasley.<br /> <br /> &quot;The one we&#39;ve all been waiting for,&quot; said George.<br /> <br /> &quot;We know Oliver&#39;s speech by heart,&quot; Fred told Harry, &quot;we were on the team last year.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up, you two,&quot; said Wood. &quot;This is the best team Gryffindor&#39;s had in years. We&#39;re going to win. I know it.&quot;<br /> <br /> He glared at them all as if to say, &quot;Or else.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right. It&#39;s time. Good luck, all of you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and, hoping his knees weren&#39;t going to give way, walked onto the field to loud cheers.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,&quot; she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mount your brooms, please.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.<br /> <br /> Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off.<br /> <br /> &quot;And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;JORDAN!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry, Professor.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Weasley twins&#39; friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commentary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;And she&#39;s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood&#39;s, last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he&#39;s going to sc -- no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that&#39;s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that&#39;s Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts, but he&#39;s blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can&#39;t tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she&#39;s really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on, now, Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE!&quot;<br /> <br /> Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from the Slytherins.<br /> <br /> &quot;Budge up there, move along.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough space to join them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bin watchin&#39; from me hut,&quot; said Hagrid, patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck, &quot;But it isn&#39;t the same as bein&#39; in the crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nope,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Harry hasn&#39;t had much to do yet.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Kept outta trouble, though, that&#39;s somethin&#39;,&quot; said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.<br /> <br /> Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood&#39;s game plan.<br /> <br /> &quot;Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,&quot; Wood had said. &quot;We don&#39;t want you attacked before you have to be.&quot;<br /> <br /> When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys&#39; wristwatches, and once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right there, Harry?&quot; he had time to yell, as he beat the Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.<br /> <br /> &quot;Slytherin in possession,&quot; Lee Jordan was saying, &quot;Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch?&quot;<br /> <br /> A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.<br /> <br /> Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch -- all the Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch.<br /> <br /> Harry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead -- he put on an extra spurt of speed --<br /> <br /> WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry&#39;s broom spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life.<br /> <br /> &quot;Foul!&quot; screamed the Gryffindors.<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.<br /> <br /> Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, &quot;Send him off, ref! Red card!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you talking about, Dean?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Red card!&quot; said Dean furiously. &quot;In soccer you get shown the red card and you&#39;re out of the game!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But this isn&#39;t soccer, Dean,&quot; Ron reminded him.<br /> <br /> Hagrid, however, was on Dean&#39;s side.<br /> <br /> &quot;They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air.&quot;<br /> <br /> Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.<br /> <br /> &quot;So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Jordan!&quot; growled Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;I mean, after that open and revolting foul...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Jordan, I&#39;m warning you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I&#39;m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees. He&#39;d never felt anything like that.<br /> <br /> It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the Gryffindor goal-posts -- he had half a mind to ask Wood to call time-out -- and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control. He couldn&#39;t turn it. He couldn&#39;t direct it at all. It was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.<br /> <br /> Lee was still commentating.<br /> <br /> &quot;Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose -- only joking, Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no...&quot;<br /> <br /> The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry&#39;s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno what Harry thinks he&#39;s doing,&quot; Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. &quot;If I didn&#39; know better, I&#39;d say he&#39;d lost control of his broom... but he can&#39;t have...&quot;<br /> <br /> Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry&#39;s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?&quot; Seamus whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t have,&quot; Hagrid said, his voice shaking. &quot;Can&#39;t nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.&quot;<br /> <br /> At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid&#39;s binoculars, but instead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you doing?&quot; moaned Ron, gray-faced.<br /> <br /> &quot;I knew it,&quot; Hermione gasped, &quot;Snape -- look.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s doing something -- jinxing the broom,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;What should we do?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Leave it to me.&quot;<br /> <br /> Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of their brooms, but it was no good - every time they got near him, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on, Hermione,&quot; Ron muttered desperately.<br /> <br /> Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn&#39;t even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape&#39;s robes.<br /> <br /> It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the row -- Snape would never know what had happened.<br /> <br /> It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Neville, you can look!&quot; Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into Hagrid&#39;s jacket for the last five minutes.<br /> <br /> Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick -- he hit the field on all fours -- coughed -- and something gold fell into his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve got the Snitch!&quot; he shouted, waving it above his head, and the game ended in complete confusion.<br /> <br /> &quot;He didn&#39;t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,&quot; Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference -- Harry hadn&#39;t broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the results -- Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid&#39;s hut, with Ron and Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was Snape,&quot; Ron was explaining, &quot;Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn&#39;t take his eyes off you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubbish,&quot; said Hagrid, who hadn&#39;t heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands. &quot;Why would Snape do somethin&#39; like that?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.<br /> <br /> &quot;I found out something about him,&quot; he told Hagrid. &quot;He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying to steal whatever it&#39;s guarding.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid dropped the teapot.<br /> <br /> &quot;How do you know about Fluffy?&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fluffy ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah -- he&#39;s mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las&#39; year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes?&quot; said Harry eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, don&#39;t ask me anymore,&quot; said Hagrid gruffly. &quot;That&#39;s top secret, that is.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But Snape&#39;s trying to steal it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubbish,&quot; said Hagrid again. &quot;Snape&#39;s a Hogwarts teacher, he&#39;d do nothin&#39; of the sort.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So why did he just try and kill Harry?&quot; cried Hermione.<br /> <br /> The afternoon&#39;s events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I&#39;ve read all about them! You&#39;ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn&#39;t blinking at all, I saw him!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m tellin&#39; yeh, yer wrong!&quot; said Hagrid hotly. &quot;I don&#39; know why Harry&#39;s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn&#39; try an&#39; kill a student! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh -- yer meddlin&#39; in things that don&#39; concern yeh. It&#39;s dangerous. You forget that dog, an&#39; you forget what it&#39;s guardin&#39;, that&#39;s between Professor Dumbledore an&#39; Nicolas Flamel--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Aha!&quot; said Harry, &quot;so there&#39;s someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked furious with himself.</p>"

          "content": "<p> Christmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.<br /> <br /> No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape&#39;s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons.<br /> <br /> &quot;I do feel so sorry,&quot; said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, &quot;for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they&#39;re not wanted at home.&quot;<br /> <br /> He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he&#39;d realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunting Harry about having no proper family.<br /> <br /> It was true that Harry wasn&#39;t going back to Privet Drive for Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week before, making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn&#39;t feel sorry for himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he&#39;d ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.<br /> <br /> When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hi, Hagrid, want any help?&quot; Ron asked, sticking his head through the branches.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nah, I&#39;m all right, thanks, Ron.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Would you mind moving out of the way?&quot; came Malfoy&#39;s cold drawl from behind them. &quot;Are you trying to earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid&#39;s must seem like a palace compared to what your family&#39;s used to.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;WEASLEY!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron let go of the front of Malfoy&#39;s robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;He was provoked, Professor Snape,&quot; said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree. &quot;Malfoy was insultin&#39; his family.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,&quot; said Snape silkily. &quot;Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn&#39;t more. Move along, all of you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll get him,&quot; said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy&#39;s back, &quot;one of these days, I&#39;ll get him--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I hate them both,&quot; said Harry, &quot;Malfoy and Snape.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on, cheer up, it&#39;s nearly Christmas,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Tell yeh what, come with me an&#39; see the Great Hall, looks a treat.&quot;<br /> <br /> So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the far corner, would you?&quot;<br /> <br /> The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles.<br /> <br /> &quot;How many days you got left until yer holidays?&quot; Hagrid asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just one,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;And that reminds me -- Harry, Ron, we&#39;ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh yeah, you&#39;re right,&quot; said Ron, tearing his eyes away from Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.<br /> <br /> &quot;The library?&quot; said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. &quot;Just before the holidays? Bit keen, aren&#39;t yeh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, we&#39;re not working,&quot; Harry told him brightly. &quot;Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we&#39;ve been trying to find out who he is.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You what ?&quot; Hagrid looked shocked. &quot;Listen here -- I&#39;ve told yeh -- drop it. It&#39;s nothin&#39; to you what that dog&#39;s guardin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that&#39;s all,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Unless you&#39;d like to tell us and save us the trouble?&quot; Harry added. &quot;We must&#39;ve been through hundreds of books already and we can&#39;t find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I&#39;ve read his name somewhere.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sayin&#39; nothin&#39;, said Hagrid flatly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just have to find out for ourselves, then,&quot; said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.<br /> <br /> They had indeed been searching books for Flamel&#39;s name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done to get himself into a book. He wasn&#39;t in Great Wizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time ; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.<br /> <br /> Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn&#39;t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books, and he knew he&#39;d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against the Dark Arts.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you looking for, boy?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better get out, then. Go on -- out!&quot;<br /> <br /> Wishing he&#39;d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they&#39;d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she&#39;d be able to tell them, but they couldn&#39;t risk Snape hearing what they were up to.<br /> <br /> Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn&#39;t very hopeful. They had been looking for two weeks, after A, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn&#39;t surprising they&#39;d found nothing. What they really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.<br /> <br /> Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off to lunch.<br /> <br /> &quot;You will keep looking while I&#39;m away, won&#39;t you?&quot; said Hermione. &quot;And send me an owl if you find anything.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,&quot; said Ron. &quot;It&#39;d be safe to ask them.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Very safe, as they&#39;re both dentists,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork -- bread, English muffins, marshmallows -- and plotting ways of getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn&#39;t work.<br /> <br /> Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron&#39;s set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to someone else in his family -- in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren&#39;t a drawback at all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted.<br /> <br /> Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn&#39;t trust him at all. He wasn&#39;t a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was confusing. &quot;Don&#39;t send me there, can&#39;t you see his knight? Send him, we can afford to lose him.&quot;<br /> <br /> On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe.<br /> <br /> &quot;You, too,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Will you look at this? I&#39;ve got some presents!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What did you expect, turnips?&quot; said Ron, turning to his own pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry&#39;s.<br /> <br /> Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it -- it sounded a bit like an owl.<br /> <br /> A second, very small parcel contained a note.<br /> <br /> We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence piece.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s friendly,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.<br /> <br /> &quot;Weird!&quot; he said, &quot;What a shape! This is money ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You can keep it,&quot; said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. &quot;Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I know who that one&#39;s from,&quot; said Ron, turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. &quot;My mom. I told her you didn&#39;t expect any presents and -- oh, no,&quot; he groaned, &quot;she&#39;s made you a Weasley sweater.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Every year she makes us a sweater,&quot; said Ron, unwrapping his own, &quot;and mine&#39;s always maroon.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s really nice of her,&quot; said Harry, trying the fudge, which was very tasty.<br /> <br /> His next present also contained candy -- a large box of Chocolate Frogs from Hermione.<br /> <br /> This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.<br /> <br /> Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve heard of those,&quot; he said in a hushed voice, dropping the box of Every Flavor Beans he&#39;d gotten from Hermione. &quot;If that&#39;s what I think it is -- they&#39;re really rare, and really valuable.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was strange to the touch, like water woven into material.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s an invisibility cloak,&quot; said Ron, a look of awe on his face. &quot;I&#39;m sure it is -- try it on.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.<br /> <br /> &quot;It is! Look down!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s a note!&quot; said Ron suddenly. &quot;A note fell out of it!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words:<br /> <br /> Your father left this in my possession before he died.<br /> <br /> It is time it was returned to you.<br /> <br /> Use it well.<br /> <br /> A Very Merry Christmas to you.<br /> <br /> There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admiring the cloak.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d give anything for one of these,&quot; he said. &quot;Anything. What&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?<br /> <br /> Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn&#39;t feel like sharing it with anyone else yet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hey, look -- Harry&#39;s got a Weasley sweater, too!&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large yellow F on it, the other a G.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry&#39;s is better than ours, though,&quot; said Fred, holding up Harry&#39;s sweater. &quot;She obviously makes more of an effort if you&#39;re not family.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why aren&#39;t you wearing yours, Ron?&quot; George demanded. &quot;Come on, get it on, they&#39;re lovely and warm.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I hate maroon,&quot; Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;You haven&#39;t got a letter on yours,&quot; George observed. &quot;I suppose she thinks you don&#39;t forget your name. But we&#39;re not stupid -- we know we&#39;re called Gred and Forge.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s all this noise?&quot;<br /> <br /> Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.<br /> <br /> &quot;P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we&#39;re all wearing ours, even Harry got one.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I -- don&#39;t -- want -- &quot; said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.<br /> <br /> &quot;And you&#39;re not sitting with the prefects today, either,&quot; said George. &quot;Christmas is a time for family.&quot;<br /> <br /> They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his side by his sweater.<br /> <br /> Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes; platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce - and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn&#39;t just bang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral&#39;s hat and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard&#39;s hat for a flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.<br /> <br /> Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who, to Harry&#39;s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.<br /> <br /> When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of nonexplodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Norris&#39;s Christmas dinner.<br /> <br /> Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn&#39;t have lost so badly if Percy hadn&#39;t tried to help him so much.<br /> <br /> After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they&#39;d stolen his prefect badge.<br /> <br /> It had been Harry&#39;s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it: the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it.<br /> <br /> Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he&#39;d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it.<br /> <br /> His father&#39;s... this had been his father&#39;s. He let the material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the note had said.<br /> <br /> He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.<br /> <br /> Use it well.<br /> <br /> Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.<br /> <br /> Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back -- his father&#39;s cloak -- he felt that this time -- the first time -- he wanted to use it alone.<br /> <br /> He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the common room, and climbed through the portrait hole.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down the corridor.<br /> <br /> Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library. He&#39;d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked.<br /> <br /> The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps.<br /> <br /> The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Stepping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles.<br /> <br /> They didn&#39;t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words in languages Harry couldn&#39;t understand. Some had no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry&#39;s neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn&#39;t be.<br /> <br /> He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.<br /> <br /> A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in the doorway; Filch&#39;s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch&#39;s outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book&#39;s shrieks still ringing in his ears.<br /> <br /> He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn&#39;t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn&#39;t recognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.<br /> <br /> &quot;You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around at night, and somebody&#39;s been in the library Restricted Section.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, &quot;The Restricted Section? Well, they can&#39;t be far, we&#39;ll catch them.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around the corner ahead. They couldn&#39;t see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they&#39;d knock right into him -- the cloak didn&#39;t stop him from being solid.<br /> <br /> He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in.<br /> <br /> It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn&#39;t look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way.<br /> <br /> It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.<br /> <br /> He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him.<br /> <br /> But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror.<br /> <br /> There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror&#39;s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?<br /> <br /> He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he&#39;d touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air - she and the others existed only in the mirror.<br /> <br /> She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. Bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up at the back, just as Harry&#39;s did.<br /> <br /> Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mom?&quot; he whispered. &quot;Dad?&quot;<br /> <br /> They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had Harry&#39;s knobbly knees -- Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.<br /> <br /> The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.<br /> <br /> How long he stood there, he didn&#39;t know. The reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. He couldn&#39;t stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother&#39;s face, whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll come back,&quot; and hurried from the room.<br /> <br /> &quot;You could have woken me up,&quot; said Ron, crossly.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can come tonight, I&#39;m going back, I want to show you the mirror.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d like to see your mom and dad,&quot; Ron said eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you&#39;ll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You can see them any old time,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren&#39;t you eating anything?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It didn&#39;t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you all right?&quot; said Ron. &quot;You look odd.&quot;<br /> <br /> What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing Harry&#39;s route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m freezing,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Let&#39;s forget it and go back.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No!&quot; Harry hissed. I know it&#39;s here somewhere.&quot;<br /> <br /> They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction, but saw no one else. just as Ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s here -- just here -- yes!&quot;<br /> <br /> They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.<br /> <br /> There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of him.<br /> <br /> &quot;See?&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;I can&#39;t see anything.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look! Look at them all... there are loads of them...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I can only see you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he couldn&#39;t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas.<br /> <br /> Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look at me!&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you see all your family standing around you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No -- I&#39;m alone -- but I&#39;m different -- I look older -- and I&#39;m head boy!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I am -- I&#39;m wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I&#39;m holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I&#39;m Quidditch captain, too.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think this mirror shows the future?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How can it? All my family are dead -- let me have another look--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re only holding the Quidditch cup, what&#39;s interesting about that? I want to see my parents.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t push me--&quot;<br /> <br /> A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion. They hadn&#39;t realized how loudly they had been talking.<br /> <br /> &quot;Quick!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking the same thing -- did the cloak work on cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.<br /> <br /> &quot;This isn&#39;t safe -- she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.&quot;<br /> <br /> And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.<br /> <br /> The snow still hadn&#39;t melted the next morning.<br /> <br /> &quot;Want to play chess, Harry?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;No.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why don&#39;t we go down and visit Hagrid?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No... you go...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don&#39;t go back tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why not?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I dunno, I&#39;ve just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway, you&#39;ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can&#39;t see you? What if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You sound like Hermione.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m serious, Harry, don&#39;t go.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn&#39;t going to stop him.<br /> <br /> That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn&#39;t meet anyone.<br /> <br /> And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.<br /> <br /> Except --<br /> <br /> &quot;So -- back again, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked behind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn&#39;t noticed him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I -- I didn&#39;t see you, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,&quot; said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;So,&quot; said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with Harry, &quot;you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I didn&#39;t know it was called that, Sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I expect you&#39;ve realized by now what it does?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It -- well -- it shows me my family--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How did you know -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t need a cloak to become invisible,&quot; said Dumbledore gently. &quot;Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shook his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought. Then he said slowly, &quot;It shows us what we want... whatever we want...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes and no,&quot; said Dumbledore quietly. &quot;It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don&#39;t you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stood up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Obviously, you&#39;ve just done so,&quot; Dumbledore smiled. &quot;You may ask me one more thing, however.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What do you see when you look in the mirror?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;One can never have enough socks,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn&#39;t get a single pair. People will insist on giving me books.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a personal question.</p> "

          "title": "Nicholas Flamel",
          "content": "<p> Dumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he&#39;d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn&#39;t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.<br /> <br /> &quot;You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,&quot; said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams.<br /> <br /> Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row (&quot;If Filch had caught you!&quot;), and disappointment that he hadn&#39;t at least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.<br /> <br /> They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a library book, even though Harry was still sure he&#39;d read the name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.<br /> <br /> Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless rain that had replaced the snow couldn&#39;t dampen his spirits. The Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wood&#39;s side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.<br /> <br /> Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He&#39;d just gotten very angry with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms.<br /> <br /> &quot;Will you stop messing around!&quot; he yelled. &quot;That&#39;s exactly the sort of thing that&#39;ll lose us the match! Snape&#39;s refereeing this time, and he&#39;ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor!&quot;<br /> <br /> George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape&#39;s refereeing?&quot; he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. &quot;When&#39;s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He&#39;s not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.&quot;<br /> <br /> The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; said Wood. &quot;We&#39;ve just got to make sure we play a clean game, so Snape hasn&#39;t got an excuse to pick on us.&quot;<br /> <br /> Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch...<br /> <br /> The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me for a moment,&quot; said Ron when Harry sat down next to him, &quot;I need to concen -- &quot; He caught sight of Harry&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter with you? You look terrible.&quot;<br /> <br /> Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the other two about Snape&#39;s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch referee.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t play,&quot; said Hermione at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Say you&#39;re ill,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Pretend to break your leg,&quot; Hermione suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;Really break your leg,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; said Harry. &quot;There isn&#39;t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can&#39;t play at all.&quot;<br /> <br /> At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone&#39;s guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor tower.<br /> <br /> Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed the countercurse. Neville&#39;s legs sprang apart and he got to his feet, trembling. &quot;What happened?&quot; Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit with Harry and Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy,&quot; said Neville shakily. &quot;I met him outside the library. He said he&#39;d been looking for someone to practice that on.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go to Professor McGonagall!&quot; Hermione urged Neville. &quot;Report him!&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville shook his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t want more trouble,&quot; he mumbled.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve got to stand up to him, Neville!&quot; said Ron. &quot;He&#39;s used to walking all over people, but that&#39;s no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s no need to tell me I&#39;m not brave enough to be in Gryffindor, Malfoy&#39;s already done that,&quot; Neville choked out.<br /> <br /> Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re worth twelve of Malfoy,&quot; Harry said. &quot;The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor, didn&#39;t it? And where&#39;s Malfoy? In stinking Slytherin.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville&#39;s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.<br /> <br /> &quot;Thanks, Harry... I think I&#39;ll go to bed... D&#39;you want the card, you collect them, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dumbledore again,&quot; he said, &quot;He was the first one I ever--&quot;<br /> <br /> He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up at Ron and Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve found him!&quot; he whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve found Flamel! I told you I&#39;d read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this: &#39;Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon&#39;s blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel&#39;!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn&#39;t looked so excited since they&#39;d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of homework.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stay there!&quot; she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls&#39; dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her arms.<br /> <br /> &quot;I never thought to look in here!&quot; she whispered excitedly. &quot;I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Light ?&quot; said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she&#39;d looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the pages, muttering to herself.<br /> <br /> At last she found what she was looking for.<br /> <br /> &quot;I knew it! I knew it!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Are we allowed to speak yet?&quot; said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nicolas Flamel,&quot; she whispered dramatically, &quot;is the only known maker of the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone!&quot;<br /> <br /> This didn&#39;t have quite the effect she&#39;d expected.<br /> <br /> &quot;The what?&quot; said Harry and Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, honestly, don&#39;t you two read? Look -- read that, there.&quot;<br /> <br /> She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:<br /> <br /> The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers. The stone will transform any metal into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal.<br /> <br /> There have been many reports of the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).<br /> <br /> &quot;See?&quot; said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. &quot;The dog must be guarding Flamel&#39;s Sorcerer&#39;s Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they&#39;re friends and he knew someone was after it, that&#39;s why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!&quot; said Harry. &quot;No wonder Snape&#39;s after it! Anyone would want it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And no wonder we couldn&#39;t find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry,&quot; said Ron. &quot;He&#39;s not exactly recent if he&#39;s six hundred and sixty-five, is he?&quot;<br /> <br /> The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they&#39;d do with a Sorcerer&#39;s Stone if they had one. It wasn&#39;t until Ron said he&#39;d buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m going to play,&quot; he told Ron and Hermione. &quot;If I don&#39;t, all the Slytherins will think I&#39;m just too scared to face Snape. I&#39;ll show them... it&#39;ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just as long as we&#39;re not wiping you off the field,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team wasn&#39;t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the house championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly know they&#39;d found out about the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone? Harry didn&#39;t see how he could -- yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.<br /> <br /> Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they&#39;d ever see him alive again. This wasn&#39;t what you&#39;d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood&#39;s pep talk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands next to Neville, who couldn&#39;t understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They&#39;d gotten the idea from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s Locomotor Mortis,&quot; Hermione muttered as Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know,&quot; Ron snapped. &quot;Don&#39;t nag.&quot;<br /> <br /> Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it&#39;s now. Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The whole school&#39;s out there!&quot; said Fred Weasley, peering out of the door. &quot;Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore&#39;s come to watch!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s heart did a somersault.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dumbledore?&quot; he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.<br /> <br /> Harry could have laughed out loud with relief He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.<br /> <br /> Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve never seen Snape look so mean,&quot; he told Hermione. &quot;Look -- they&#39;re off. Ouch!&quot;<br /> <br /> Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn&#39;t see you there.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wonder how long Potter&#39;s going to stay on his broom this time? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron didn&#39;t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch.<br /> <br /> &quot;You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team?&quot; said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. &quot;It&#39;s people they feel sorry for. See, there&#39;s Potter, who&#39;s got no parents, then there&#39;s the Weasleys, who&#39;ve got no money -- you should be on the team, Longbottom, you&#39;ve got no brains.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,&quot; he stammered.<br /> <br /> Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, &quot;You tell him, Neville.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Longbottom, if brains were gold you&#39;d be poorer than Weasley, and that&#39;s saying something.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m warning you, Malfoy -- one more word--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron!&quot; said Hermione suddenly, &quot;Harry--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What? Where?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re in luck, Weasley, Potter&#39;s obviously spotted some money on the ground!&quot; said Malfoy.<br /> <br /> Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over the back of his seat to help.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on, Harry!&quot; Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape -- she didn&#39;t even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.<br /> <br /> Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches -- the next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in triumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand.<br /> <br /> The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever remember the Snitch being caught so quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game&#39;s over! Harry&#39;s won! We&#39;ve won! Gryffindor is in the lead!&quot; shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in front.<br /> <br /> Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn&#39;t believe it. He&#39;d done it -- the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore&#39;s smiling face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well done,&quot; said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. &quot;Nice to see you haven&#39;t been brooding about that mirror... been keeping busy... excellent...&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape spat bitterly on the ground.<br /> <br /> Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn&#39;t ever remember feeling happier. He&#39;d really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur: Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed.<br /> <br /> Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He&#39;d done it, he&#39;d shown Snape...<br /> <br /> And speaking of Snape...<br /> <br /> A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest. Harry&#39;s victory faded from his mind as he watched. He recognized the figure&#39;s prowling walk. Snape, sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on?<br /> <br /> Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run. He followed.<br /> <br /> The trees were so thick he couldn&#39;t see where Snape had gone. He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree.<br /> <br /> He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves.<br /> <br /> Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn&#39;t alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn&#39;t make out the look on his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch what they were saying.<br /> <br /> &quot;... d-don&#39;t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-places, Severus...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, I thought we&#39;d keep this private,&quot; said Snape, his voice icy. &quot;Students aren&#39;t supposed to know about the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, after all.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid&#39;s yet?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;B-b-but Severus, I--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,&quot; said Snape, taking a step toward him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I-I don&#39;t know what you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You know perfectly well what I mean.&quot;<br /> <br /> An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, &quot; -- your little bit of hocus-pocus. I&#39;m waiting.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;B-but I d-d-don&#39;t--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Very well,&quot; Snape cut in. &quot;We&#39;ll have another little chat soon, when you&#39;ve had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.&quot;<br /> <br /> He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still as though he was petrified.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, where have you been ?&quot; Hermione squeaked.<br /> <br /> &quot;We won! You won! We won!&quot; shouted Ron, thumping Harry on the back. &quot;And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He&#39;s still out cold but Madam Pomfrey says he&#39;ll be all right -- talk about showing Slytherin! I&#39;ve waiting for you in the common room, we&#39;re having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Never mind that now,&quot; said Harry breathlessly. &quot;Let&#39;s find an empty room, you wait &#39;til you hear this...&quot;<br /> <br /> He made sure Peeves wasn&#39;t inside before shutting the door behind them, then he told them what he&#39;d seen and heard.<br /> <br /> &quot;So we were right, it is the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, and Snape&#39;s trying to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy -- and he said something about Quirrell&#39;s &#39;hocus pocus&#39; -- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So you mean the Stone&#39;s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?&quot; said Hermione in alarm.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;ll be gone by next Tuesday,&quot; said Ron.</p>"

          "content": "<p> Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they&#39;d thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner, but it didn&#39;t look as though he&#39;d cracked yet.<br /> <br /> Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for laughing at Quirrell&#39;s stutter.<br /> <br /> Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn&#39;t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, the exams are ages away.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ten weeks,&quot; Hermione snapped. &quot;That&#39;s not ages, that&#39;s like a second to Nicolas Flamel.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But we&#39;re not six hundred years old,&quot; Ron reminded her. &quot;Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it&#39;s an A.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year? They&#39;re very important, I should have started studying a month ago, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s gotten into me...&quot;<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them that the Easter holidays weren&#39;t nearly as much fun as the Christmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the twelve uses of dragon&#39;s blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll never remember this,&quot; Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window. It was the first really fine day they&#39;d had in months. The sky was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of summer coming.<br /> <br /> Harry, who was looking up &quot;Dittany&quot; in One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn&#39;t look up until he heard Ron say, &quot;Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Jus&#39; lookin&#39;,&quot; he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at once. &quot;An&#39; what&#39;re you lot up ter?&quot; He looked suddenly suspicious. &quot;Yer not still lookin&#39; fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,&quot; said Ron impressively. &quot;And we know what that dog&#39;s guarding, it&#39;s a Sorcerer&#39;s St--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shhhh!&quot; Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was listening. &quot;Don&#39; go shoutin&#39; about it, what&#39;s the matter with yeh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of fact,&quot; said Harry, &quot;about what&#39;s guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;SHHHH!&quot; said Hagrid again. &quot;Listen -- come an&#39; see me later, I&#39;m not promisin&#39; I&#39;ll tell yeh anythin&#39;, mind, but don&#39; go rabbitin&#39; about it in here, students aren&#39; s&#39;pposed ter know. They&#39;ll think I&#39;ve told yeh--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;See you later, then,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Hagrid shuffled off.<br /> <br /> &quot;What was he hiding behind his back?&quot; said Hermione thoughtfully.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m going to see what section he was in,&quot; said Ron, who&#39;d had enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dragons!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper&#39;s Guide.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid&#39;s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I ever met him, &quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;But it&#39;s against our laws,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks&#39; Convention of 1709, everyone knows that. It&#39;s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we&#39;re keeping dragons in the back garden -- anyway, you can&#39;t tame dragons, it&#39;s dangerous. You should see the burns Charlie&#39;s got off wild ones in Romania.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But there aren&#39;t wild dragons in Britain ?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course there are,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who&#39;ve spotted them, to make them forget.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So what on earth&#39;s Hagrid up to?&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper&#39;s hut an hour later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. Hagrid called &quot;Who is it?&quot; before he let them in, and then shut the door quickly behind them.<br /> <br /> It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.<br /> <br /> &quot;So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin&#39;?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush. &quot;We were wondering if you could tell us what&#39;s guarding the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone apart from Fluffy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid frowned at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;O&#39; course I can&#39;t,&quot; he said. &quot;Number one, I don&#39; know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn&#39; tell yeh if I could. That Stone&#39;s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts -- I s&#39;ppose yeh&#39;ve worked that out an&#39; all? Beats me how yeh even know abou&#39; Fluffy.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes on round here,&quot; said Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid&#39;s beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. &quot;We only wondered who had done the guarding, really.&quot; Hermione went on. &quot;We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron beamed at Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I don&#39; s&#39;pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that... let&#39;s see... he borrowed Fluffy from me... then some o&#39; the teachers did enchantments... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall -- &quot; he ticked them off on his fingers, &quot;Professor Quirrell -- an&#39; Dumbledore himself did somethin&#39;, o&#39; course. Hang on, I&#39;ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah -- yer not still on abou&#39; that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect the Stone, he&#39;s not about ter steal it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, Quirrell&#39;s spell and how to get past Fluffy.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy. aren&#39;t you, Hagrid?&quot; said Harry anxiously. &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t tell anyone, would you? Not even one of the teachers?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not a soul knows except me an&#39; Dumbledore,&quot; said Hagrid proudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, that&#39;s something,&quot; Harry muttered to the others. &quot;Hagrid, can we have a window open? I&#39;m boiling.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t, Harry, sorry,&quot; said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at the fire. Harry looked at it, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid -- what&#39;s that ?&quot;<br /> <br /> But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, underneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah,&quot; said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, &quot;That&#39;s -- er...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Where did you get it, Hagrid?&quot; said Ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. &quot;It must&#39;ve cost you a fortune.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Won it,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;Las&#39; night. I was down in the village havin&#39; a few drinks an&#39; got into a game o&#39; cards with a stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But what are you going to do with it when it&#39;s hatched?&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I&#39;ve bin doin&#39; some readin&#39;,&quot; said Hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. &quot;Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it&#39;s a bit outta date, o&#39; course, but it&#39;s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, &#39;cause their mothers breathe on I em, see, an&#39; when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o&#39; brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An&#39; see here -- how ter recognize diff&#39;rent eggs -- what I got there&#39;s a Norwegian Ridgeback. They&#39;re rare, them.&quot;<br /> <br /> He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn&#39;t.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> But Hagrid wasn&#39;t listening. He was humming merrily as he stoked the fire.<br /> <br /> So now they had something else to worry about: what might happen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wonder what it&#39;s like to have a peaceful life,&quot; Ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.<br /> <br /> Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It&#39;s hatching.<br /> <br /> Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. Hermione wouldn&#39;t hear of it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got lessons, we&#39;ll get into trouble, and that&#39;s nothing to what Hagrid&#39;s going to be in when someone finds out what he&#39;s doing--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up!&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn&#39;t like the look on Malfoy&#39;s face at all.<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid&#39;s with the other two during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s nearly out.&quot; He ushered them inside.<br /> <br /> The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Something was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.<br /> <br /> They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with bated breath.<br /> <br /> All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn&#39;t exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes.<br /> <br /> It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.<br /> <br /> &quot;Isn&#39;t he beautiful ?&quot; Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand to stroke the dragon&#39;s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing pointed fangs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!&quot; said Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid,&quot; said Hermione, &quot;how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face -- he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Someone was lookin&#39; through the gap in the curtains -- it&#39;s a kid -- he&#39;s runnin&#39; back up ter the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there was no mistaking him.<br /> <br /> Malfoy had seen the dragon.<br /> <br /> Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy&#39;s face during the next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most of their free time in Hagrid&#39;s darkened hut, trying to reason with him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just let him go,&quot; Harry urged. &quot;Set him free.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;He&#39;s too little. He&#39;d die.&quot;<br /> <br /> They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn&#39;t been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over the floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve decided to call him Norbert,&quot; said Hagrid, looking at the dragon with misty eyes. &quot;He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where&#39;s Mommy?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s lost his marbles,&quot; Ron muttered in Harry&#39;s ear.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid,&quot; said Harry loudly, &quot;give it two weeks and Norbert&#39;s going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid bit his lip.<br /> <br /> &quot;I -- I know I can&#39;t keep him forever, but I can&#39;t jus&#39; dump him, I can&#39;t.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry suddenly turned to Ron. &quot;Charlie.&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re losing it, too,&quot; said Ron. &quot;I&#39;m Ron, remember?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No -- Charlie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Brilliant!&quot; said Ron. &quot;How about it, Hagrid?&quot;<br /> <br /> And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to Charlie to ask him.<br /> <br /> The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry&#39;s invisibility cloak. He had been down at Hagrid&#39;s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate.<br /> <br /> &quot;It bit me!&quot; he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be able to hold a quill for a week. I tell you, that dragon&#39;s the most horrible animal I&#39;ve ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you&#39;d think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a tap on the dark window.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s Hedwig!&quot; said Harry, hurrying to let her in. &quot;She&#39;ll have Charlie&#39;s answer!&quot;<br /> <br /> The three of them put their heads together to read the note.<br /> <br /> Dear Ron,<br /> <br /> How are you? Thanks for the letter -- I&#39;d be glad to take the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won&#39;t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn&#39;t be seen carrying an illegal dragon.<br /> <br /> Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it&#39;s still dark.<br /> <br /> Send me an answer as soon as possible.<br /> <br /> Love,<br /> <br /> Charlie<br /> <br /> They looked at one another.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got the invisibility cloak,&quot; said Harry. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be too difficult - I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- and Malfoy.<br /> <br /> There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron&#39;s bitten hand had swollen to twice its usual size. He didn&#39;t know whether it was safe to go to Madam Pomfrey -- would she recognize a dragon bite? By the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert&#39;s fangs were poisonous.<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not just my hand,&quot; he whispered, &quot;although that feels like it&#39;s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I&#39;ve told her it was a dog, but I don&#39;t think she believes me -- I shouldn&#39;t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that&#39;s why he&#39;s doing this.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,&quot; said Hermione, but this didn&#39;t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Midnight on Saturday!&quot; he said in a hoarse voice. &quot;Oh no oh no -- I&#39;ve just remembered -- Charlie&#39;s letter was in that book Malfoy took, he&#39;s going to know we&#39;re getting rid of Norbert.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione didn&#39;t get a chance to answer. Madam Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s too late to change the plan now,&quot; Harry told Hermione. &quot;We haven&#39;t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert. We&#39;ll have to risk it. And we have got the invisibility cloak, Malfoy doesn&#39;t know about that.&quot;<br /> <br /> They found Fang, the boarhound, sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to talk to them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I won&#39;t let you in,&quot; he puffed. &quot;Norbert&#39;s at a tricky stage -- nothin&#39; I can&#39;t handle.&quot;<br /> <br /> When they told him about Charlie&#39;s letter, his eyes filled with tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him on the leg.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aargh! It&#39;s all right, he only got my boot -- jus&#39; playin&#39; -- he&#39;s only a baby, after all.&quot;<br /> <br /> The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday couldn&#39;t come quickly enough.<br /> <br /> They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn&#39;t been so worried about what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they were a bit late arriving at Hagrid&#39;s hut because they&#39;d had to wait for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he&#39;d been playing tennis against the wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s got lots o&#39; rats an&#39; some brandy fer the journey,&quot; said Hagrid in a muffled voice. &quot;An&#39; I&#39;ve packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely.&quot;<br /> <br /> From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry as though the teddy was having his head torn off.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bye-bye, Norbert!&quot; Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. &quot;Mommy will never forget you!&quot;<br /> <br /> How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another -- even one of Harry&#39;s shortcuts didn&#39;t make the work much easier.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nearly there!&quot; Harry panted as they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower.<br /> <br /> Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfoy by the ear.<br /> <br /> &quot;Detention!&quot; she shouted. &quot;And twenty points from Slytherin! Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t understand, Professor. Harry Potter&#39;s coming -- he&#39;s got a dragon!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!&quot;<br /> <br /> The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they&#39;d stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy&#39;s got detention! I could sing!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; Harry advised her.<br /> <br /> Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out of the darkness.<br /> <br /> Charlie&#39;s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione the harness they&#39;d rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and thanked them very much.<br /> <br /> At last, Norbert was going... going... gone.<br /> <br /> They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon -- Malfoy in detention -- what could spoil their happiness?<br /> <br /> The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they stepped into the corridor, Filch&#39;s face loomed suddenly out of the darkness.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, well, well,&quot; he whispered, &quot;we are in trouble.&quot;<br /> <br /> They&#39;d left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower.</p>"

          "title": "The Forbidden Forest",
          "content": "<p> Things couldn&#39;t have been worse.<br /> <br /> Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall&#39;s study on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry&#39;s brain, each more feeble than the last. He couldn&#39;t see how they were going to get out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the invisibility cloak, and they might as well be packing their bags already.<br /> <br /> Had Harry thought that things couldn&#39;t have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry!&quot; Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. &quot;I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower. It&#39;s one o&#39;clock in the morning. Explain yourselves.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher&#39;s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I&#39;ve got a good idea of what&#39;s been going on,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;It doesn&#39;t take a genius to work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to get him out of bed and into trouble. I&#39;ve already caught him. I suppose you think it&#39;s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry caught Neville&#39;s eye and tried to tell him without words that this wasn&#39;t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville -- Harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m disgusted,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;Four students out of bed in one night! I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of you will receive detentions -- yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days, it&#39;s very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Fifty ?&quot; Harry gasped -- they would lose the lead, the lead he&#39;d won in the last Quidditch match.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fifty points each,&quot; said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor -- please--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You can&#39;t--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I can and can&#39;t do, Potter. Now get back to bed, all of you. I&#39;ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students.&quot;<br /> <br /> A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last place. In one night, they&#39;d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had for the house cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn&#39;t think of anything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryffindor found out what they&#39;d done?<br /> <br /> At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded the house points the next day thought there&#39;d been a mistake. How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first years.<br /> <br /> From being one of the most popular and admired people at the school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to see Slytherin lose the house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn&#39;t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past them, whistling and cheering, &quot;Thanks Potter, we owe you one!&quot;<br /> <br /> Only Ron stood by him.<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they&#39;ve been here, and people still like them.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, though, have they?&quot; said Harry miserably.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well -- no,&quot; Ron admitted.<br /> <br /> It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself not to meddle in things that weren&#39;t his business from now on. He&#39;d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the Quidditch team.<br /> <br /> &quot;Resign ?&quot; Wood thundered. &quot;What good&#39;ll that do? How are we going to get any points back if we can&#39;t win at Quidditch?&quot;<br /> <br /> But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team wouldn&#39;t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak about him, they called him &quot;the Seeker.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn&#39;t have as bad a time as Harry, because they weren&#39;t as well-known, but nobody would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in silence.<br /> <br /> Harry was almost glad that the exams weren&#39;t far away. All the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions...<br /> <br /> Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry&#39;s new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn&#39;t concern him was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell&#39;s voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;No -- no -- not again, please--&quot;<br /> <br /> It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right -- all right -- &quot; he heard Quirrell sob.<br /> <br /> Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn&#39;t think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell&#39;s footsteps had disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he&#39;d promised himself about not meddling.<br /> <br /> All the same, he&#39;d have gambled twelve Sorcerer&#39;s Stones that Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step -- Quirrell seemed to have given in at last.<br /> <br /> Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he&#39;d heard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape&#39;s done it, then!&quot; said Ron. &quot;If Quirrell&#39;s told him how to break his Anti-Dark Force spell--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s still Fluffy, though,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Maybe Snape&#39;s found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid,&quot; said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surrounding them. &quot;I bet there&#39;s a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron&#39;s eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go to Dumbledore. That&#39;s what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we&#39;ll be thrown out for sure.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But we&#39;ve got no proof!&quot; said Harry. &quot;Quirrell&#39;s too scared to back us up. Snape&#39;s only got to say he doesn&#39;t know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they&#39;ll believe, him or us? It&#39;s not exactly a secret we hate him, Dumbledore&#39;ll think we made it up to get him sacked. Filch wouldn&#39;t help us if his life depended on it, he&#39;s too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the better, he&#39;ll think. And don&#39;t forget, we&#39;re not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy. That&#39;ll take a lot of explaining.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn&#39;t.<br /> <br /> &quot;If we just do a bit of poking around--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry flatly, &quot;we&#39;ve done enough poking around.&quot;<br /> <br /> He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the names of its moons.<br /> <br /> The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione, and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:<br /> <br /> Your detention will take place at eleven o&#39;clock tonight.<br /> <br /> Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall<br /> <br /> Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor over the points they&#39;d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn&#39;t say a word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they&#39;d got.<br /> <br /> At eleven o&#39;clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. Filch was already there -- and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;Follow me,&quot; said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them outside.<br /> <br /> &quot;I bet you&#39;ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, won&#39;t you, eh?&quot; he said, leering at them. &quot;Oh yes... hard work and pain are the best teachers if you ask me... It&#39;s just a pity they let the old punishments die out... hang you by your wrists from the ceiling for a few days, I&#39;ve got the chains still in my office, keep &#39;em well oiled in case they&#39;re ever needed... Right, off we go, and don&#39;t think of running off, now, it&#39;ll be worse for you if you do.&quot;<br /> <br /> They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn&#39;t be sounding so delighted.<br /> <br /> The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted windows of Hagrid&#39;s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid it wouldn&#39;t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, because Filch said, &quot;I suppose you think you&#39;ll be enjoying yourself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it&#39;s into the forest you&#39;re going and I&#39;m much mistaken if you&#39;ll all come out in one piece.&quot;<br /> <br /> At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in his tracks.<br /> <br /> &quot;The forest?&quot; he repeated, and he didn&#39;t sound quite as cool as usual. &quot;We can&#39;t go in there at night -- there&#39;s all sorts of things in there -- werewolves, I heard.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry&#39;s robe and made a choking noise.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s your problem, isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Filch, his voice cracking with glee. &quot;Should&#39;ve thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble, shouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over his shoulder.<br /> <br /> &quot;Abou&#39; time,&quot; he said. &quot;I bin waitin&#39; fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,&quot; said Filch coldly, they&#39;re here to be punished, after all.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s why yer late, is it?&quot; said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. &quot;Bin lecturin&#39; them, eh? &#39;Snot your place ter do that. Yeh&#39;ve done yer bit, I&#39;ll take over from here.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be back at dawn,&quot; said Filch, &quot;for what&#39;s left of them,&quot; he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his lamp bobbing away in the darkness.<br /> <br /> Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not going in that forest,&quot; he said, and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,&quot; said Hagrid fiercely. &quot;Yeh&#39;ve done wrong an&#39; now yeh&#39;ve got ter pay fer it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But this is servant stuff, it&#39;s not for students to do. I thought we&#39;d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he&#39;d--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;-- tell yer that&#39;s how it is at Hogwarts,&quot; Hagrid growled. &quot;Copyin&#39; lines! What good&#39;s that ter anyone? Yeh&#39;ll do summat useful or yeh&#39;ll get out. If yeh think yer father&#39;d rather you were expelled, then get back off ter the castle an&#39; pack. Go on.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy didn&#39;t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.<br /> <br /> &quot;Right then,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;now, listen carefully, &#39;cause it&#39;s dangerous what we&#39;re gonna do tonight, an&#39; I don&#39; want no one takin&#39; risks. Follow me over here a moment.&quot;<br /> <br /> He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as they looked into the forest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look there,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;see that stuff shinin&#39; on the ground? Silvery stuff? That&#39;s unicorn blood. There&#39;s a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We&#39;re gonna try an&#39; find the poor thing. We might have ter put it out of its misery.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?&quot; said Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s nothin&#39; that lives in the forest that&#39;ll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;An&#39; keep ter the path. Right, now, we&#39;re gonna split inter two parties an&#39; follow the trail in diff&#39;rent directions. There&#39;s blood all over the place, it must&#39;ve bin staggerin&#39; around since last night at least.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I want Fang,&quot; said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang&#39;s long teeth.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, but I warn yeh, he&#39;s a coward,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;So me, Harry, an&#39; Hermione&#39;ll go one way an&#39; Draco, Neville, an&#39; Fang&#39;ll go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we&#39;ll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an&#39; practice now -- that&#39;s it -- an&#39; if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an&#39; we&#39;ll all come an&#39; find yeh -- so, be careful -- let&#39;s go.&quot;<br /> <br /> The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right.<br /> <br /> They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.<br /> <br /> Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.<br /> <br /> &quot;Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?&quot; Harry asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not fast enough,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;It&#39;s not easy ter catch a unicorn, they&#39;re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.&quot;<br /> <br /> They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.<br /> <br /> &quot;You all right, Hermione?&quot; Hagrid whispered. &quot;Don&#39; worry, it can&#39;t&#39;ve gone far if it&#39;s this badly hurt, an&#39; then we&#39;ll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squinting up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded away.<br /> <br /> &quot;I knew it,&quot; he murmured. &quot;There&#39;s summat in here that shouldn&#39; be.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A werewolf?&quot; Harry suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;That wasn&#39; no werewolf an&#39; it wasn&#39; no unicorn, neither,&quot; said Hagrid grimly. &quot;Right, follow me, but careful, now.&quot;<br /> <br /> They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Hagrid called. &quot;Show yerself -- I&#39;m armed!&quot;<br /> <br /> And into the clearing came -- was it a man, or a horse? To the waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse&#39;s gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione&#39;s jaws dropped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Ronan,&quot; said Hagrid in relief. &quot;How are yeh?&quot;<br /> <br /> He walked forward and shook the centaur&#39;s hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good evening to you, Hagrid,&quot; said Ronan. He had a deep, sorrowful voice. &quot;Were you going to shoot me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t be too careful, Ronan,&quot; said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. &quot;There&#39;s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an&#39; Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An&#39; this is Ronan, you two. He&#39;s a centaur.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;d noticed,&quot; said Hermione faintly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good evening,&quot; said Ronan. &quot;Students, are you? And do you learn much, up at the school?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Erm--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A bit,&quot; said Hermione timidly.<br /> <br /> &quot;A bit. Well, that&#39;s something.&quot; Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared at the sky. &quot;Mars is bright tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Hagrid, glancing up, too. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve run inter yeh, Ronan, &#39;cause there&#39;s a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin&#39;?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ronan didn&#39;t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Always the innocent are the first victims,&quot; he said. &quot;So it has been for ages past, so it is now.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Hagrid, &quot;but have yeh seen anythin&#39; Ronan? Anythin&#39; unusual?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Mars is bright tonight,&quot; Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. &quot;Unusually bright.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, but I was meanin&#39; anythin&#39; unusual a bit nearer home, said Hagrid. &quot;So yeh haven&#39;t noticed anythin&#39; strange?&quot;<br /> <br /> Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, &quot;The forest hides many secrets.&quot;<br /> <br /> A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hullo, Bane,&quot; said Hagrid. &quot;All right?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well enough. Look, I&#39;ve jus&#39; bin askin&#39; Ronan, you seen anythin&#39; odd in here lately? There&#39;s a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin&#39; about it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward. &quot;Mars is bright tonight,&quot; he said simply.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve heard,&quot; said Hagrid grumpily. &quot;Well, if either of you do see anythin&#39;, let me know, won&#39;t yeh? We&#39;ll be off, then.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked their view.<br /> <br /> &quot;Never,&quot; said Hagrid irritably, &quot;try an&#39; get a straight answer out of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin&#39; closer&#39;n the moon.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Are there many of them in here?&quot; asked Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but they&#39;re good enough about turnin&#39; up if ever I want a word. They&#39;re deep, mind, centaurs... they know things... jus&#39; don&#39; let on much.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what&#39;s bin killin&#39; the unicorns -- never heard anythin&#39; like it before.&quot;<br /> <br /> They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid&#39;s arm.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You two wait here!&quot; Hagrid shouted. &quot;Stay on the path, I&#39;ll come back for yeh!&quot;<br /> <br /> They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn&#39;t hear anything but the rustling of leaves around them.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t think they&#39;ve been hurt, do you?&quot; whispered Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t care if Malfoy has, but if something&#39;s got Neville... it&#39;s our fault he&#39;s here in the first place.&quot;<br /> <br /> The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry&#39;s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?<br /> <br /> At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid&#39;s return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll be lucky ter catch anythin&#39; now, with the racket you two were makin&#39;. Right, we&#39;re changin&#39; groups -- Neville, you stay with me an&#39; Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an&#39; this idiot. I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, &quot;but he&#39;ll have a harder time frightenin&#39; you, an&#39; we&#39;ve gotta get this done.&quot;<br /> <br /> So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look -- &quot; he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy.<br /> <br /> Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They inched closer.<br /> <br /> It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly-white on the dark leaves.<br /> <br /> Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clearing quivered... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal&#39;s side, and began to drink its blood.<br /> <br /> &quot;AAAAAAAAAARGH!&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted -- so did Fang. The hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came swiftly toward Harry -- he couldn&#39;t move for fear.<br /> <br /> Then a pain like he&#39;d never felt before pierced his head; it was as though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging at the figure.<br /> <br /> The pain in Harry&#39;s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you all right?&quot; said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes -- thank you -- what was that?&quot;<br /> <br /> The centaur didn&#39;t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry&#39;s forehead.<br /> <br /> &quot;You are the Potter boy,&quot; he said. &quot;You had better get back to Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.<br /> <br /> &quot;My name is Firenze,&quot; he added, as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.<br /> <br /> There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.<br /> <br /> &quot;Firenze!&quot; Bane thundered. &quot;What are you doing? You have a human on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you realize who this is?&quot; said Firenze. &quot;This is the Potter boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What have you been telling him?&quot; growled Bane. &quot;Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ronan pawed the ground nervously. &quot;I&#39;m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,&quot; he said in his gloomy voice.<br /> <br /> Bane kicked his back legs in anger.<br /> <br /> &quot;For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!&quot;<br /> <br /> Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you not see that unicorn?&quot; Firenze bellowed at Bane. &quot;Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.&quot;<br /> <br /> And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why&#39;s Bane so angry?&quot; he asked. &quot;What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry&#39;s question. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long that Harry thought Firenze didn&#39;t want to talk to him anymore. They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry, startled by the odd question. &quot;We&#39;ve only used the horn and tail hair in Potions.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,&quot; said Firenze. &quot;Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared at the back of Firenze&#39;s head, which was dappled silver in the moonlight.<br /> <br /> &quot;But who&#39;d be that desperate?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;If you&#39;re going to be cursed forever, death&#39;s better, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It is,&quot; Firenze agreed, &quot;unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone! Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I don&#39;t understand who--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry&#39;s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: &quot;Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you mean,&quot; Harry croaked, &quot;that was Vol-&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry! Harry, are you all right?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. &quot;The unicorn&#39;s dead, Hagrid, it&#39;s in that clearing back there.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This is where I leave you,&quot; Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn. &quot;You are safe now.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry slid off his back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good luck, Harry Potter,&quot; said Firenze. &quot;The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.&quot;<br /> <br /> He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.<br /> <br /> Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what had happened in the forest.<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the fire. He was still shaking.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape wants the stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort&#39;s waiting in the forest... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop saying the name!&quot; said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he thought Voldemort could hear them.<br /> <br /> Harry wasn&#39;t listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Firenze saved me, but he shouldn&#39;t have done so... Bane was furious... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen... They must show that Voldemort&#39;s coming back... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me... I suppose that&#39;s written in the stars as well.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Will you stop saying the name!&quot; Ron hissed.<br /> <br /> &quot;So all I&#39;ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,&quot; Harry went on feverishly, &quot;then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off... Well, I suppose Bane&#39;ll be happy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of comfort.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, everyone says Dumbledore&#39;s the only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid of with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won&#39;t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says that&#39;s a very imprecise branch of magic.&quot;<br /> <br /> The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night&#39;s surprises weren&#39;t over.<br /> <br /> When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned to it:<br /> <br /> Just in case.</p> "

          "title": "Through the Trapdoor",
          "content": "<p> In years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind the locked door.<br /> <br /> It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anticheating spell.<br /> <br /> They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox -- points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.<br /> <br /> Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn&#39;t sleep, but the truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it.<br /> <br /> Maybe it was because they hadn&#39;t seen what Harry had seen in the forest, or because they didn&#39;t have scars burning on their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn&#39;t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn&#39;t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with their studying they didn&#39;t have much time to fret about what Snape or anyone else might be up to.<br /> <br /> Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who&#39;d invented selfstirring cauldrons and they&#39;d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn&#39;t help cheering with the rest.<br /> <br /> &quot;That was far easier than I thought it would be,&quot; said Hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. &quot;I needn&#39;t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was basking in the warm shallows. &quot;No more studying,&quot; Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the grass. &quot;You could look more cheerful, Harry, we&#39;ve got a week before we find out how badly we&#39;ve done, there&#39;s no need to worry yet.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was rubbing his forehead.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wish I knew what this means!&quot; he burst out angrily. &quot;My scar keeps hurting -- it&#39;s happened before, but never as often as this.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go to Madam Pomfrey,&quot; Hermione suggested.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not ill,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I think it&#39;s a warning... it means danger&#39;s coming...&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron couldn&#39;t get worked up, it was too hot.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, relax, Hermione&#39;s right, the Stone&#39;s safe as long as Dumbledore&#39;s around. Anyway, we&#39;ve never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he&#39;s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nodded, but he couldn&#39;t shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he&#39;d forgotten to do, something important. When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, &quot;That&#39;s just the exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we&#39;d done that one.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn&#39;t have anything to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past Fluffy... never... but...<br /> <br /> Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Where&#39;re you going?&quot; said Ron sleepily.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve just thought of something,&quot; said Harry. He had turned white. &quot;We&#39;ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why?&quot; panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit odd,&quot; said Harry, scrambling up the grassy slope, &quot;that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it&#39;s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don&#39;t you think? Why didn&#39;t I see it before?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across the grounds toward the forest, didn&#39;t answer.<br /> <br /> Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large bowl.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hullo,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;Finished yer exams? Got time fer a drink?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, please,&quot; said Ron, but Harry cut him off.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, we&#39;re in a hurry. Hagrid, I&#39;ve got to ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno,&quot; said Hagrid casually, &quot;he wouldn&#39; take his cloak off.&quot;<br /> <br /> He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o&#39; funny folk in the Hog&#39;s Head -- that&#39;s the pub down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon dealer, mightn&#39; he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas. &quot;What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts at all?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Mighta come up,&quot; said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. &quot;Yeah... he asked what I did, an&#39; I told him I was gamekeeper here... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after... so I told him... an&#39; I said what I&#39;d always really wanted was a dragon... an&#39; then... I can&#39; remember too well, &#39;cause he kept buyin&#39; me drinks... Let&#39;s see... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an&#39; we could play cards fer it if I wanted... but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn&#39; want it ter go ter any old home... So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy?&quot; Harry asked, trying to keep his voice calm.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well -- yeah -- how many three-headed dogs d&#39;yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy&#39;s a piece o&#39; cake if yeh know how to calm him down, jus&#39; play him a bit o&#39; music an&#39; he&#39;ll go straight off ter sleep--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.<br /> <br /> &quot;I shouldn&#39;ta told yeh that!&quot; he blurted out. &quot;Forget I said it! Hey -- where&#39;re yeh goin&#39;?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn&#39;t speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after the grounds.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got to go to Dumbledore,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must&#39;ve been easy, once he&#39;d got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn&#39;t stop him. Where&#39;s Dumbledore&#39;s office?&quot;<br /> <br /> They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll just have to -- &quot; Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang across the hall.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you three doing inside?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books.<br /> <br /> &quot;We want to see Professor Dumbledore,&quot; said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.<br /> <br /> &quot;See Professor Dumbledore?&quot; Professor McGonagall repeated, as though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. &quot;Why?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry swallowed -- now what?<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s sort of secret,&quot; he said, but he wished at once he hadn&#39;t, because Professor McGonagall&#39;s nostrils flared.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,&quot; she said coldly. &quot;He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s gone ?&quot; said Harry frantically. &quot;Now?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands on his time--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But this is important.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic, Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look,&quot; said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, &quot;Professor -- it&#39;s about the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone--&quot;<br /> <br /> Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn&#39;t that. The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn&#39;t pick them up.<br /> <br /> &quot;How do you know -- ?&quot; she spluttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor, I think -- I know -- that Sn -- that someone&#39;s going to try and steal the Stone. I&#39;ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.&quot;<br /> <br /> She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,&quot; she said finally. I don&#39;t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it&#39;s too well protected.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But Professor--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, I know what I&#39;m talking about,&quot; she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up the fallen books. I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.&quot;<br /> <br /> But they didn&#39;t.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s tonight,&quot; said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out of earshot. &quot;Snape&#39;s going through the trapdoor tonight. He&#39;s found out everything he needs, and now he&#39;s got Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But what can we--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.<br /> <br /> Snape was standing there.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good afternoon,&quot; he said smoothly.<br /> <br /> They stared at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be inside on a day like this,&quot; he said, with an odd, twisted smile.<br /> <br /> &quot;We were -- &quot; Harry began, without any idea what he was going to say.<br /> <br /> &quot;You want to be more careful,&quot; said Snape. &quot;Hanging around like this, people will think you&#39;re up to something. And Gryffindor really can&#39;t afford to lose any more points, can it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Be warned, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.&quot;<br /> <br /> He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.<br /> <br /> Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others.<br /> <br /> &quot;Right, here&#39;s what we&#39;ve got to do,&quot; he whispered urgently. &quot;One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you&#39;d better do that.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s obvious,&quot; said Ron. &quot;You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know.&quot; He put on a high voice, &quot;&#39;Oh Professor Flitwick, I&#39;m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong... &#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out for Snape.<br /> <br /> &quot;And we&#39;d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,&quot; Harry told Ron. &quot;Come on.&quot;<br /> <br /> But that part of the plan didn&#39;t work. No sooner had they reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.<br /> <br /> &quot;I suppose you think you&#39;re harder to get past than a pack of enchantments!&quot; she stormed. &quot;Enough of this nonsense! If I hear you&#39;ve come anywhere near here again, I&#39;ll take another fifty points from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron went back to the common room, Harry had just said, &quot;At least Hermione&#39;s on Snape&#39;s tail,&quot; when the portrait of the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Harry!&quot; she wailed. &quot;Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape went to get him, and I&#39;ve only just got away, I don&#39;t know where Snape went.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, that&#39;s it then, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Harry said.<br /> <br /> The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m going out of here tonight and I&#39;m going to try and get to the Stone first.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re mad!&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can&#39;t!&quot; said Hermione. &quot;After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You&#39;ll be expelled!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;SO WHAT&quot; Harry shouted. &quot;Don&#39;t you understand? If Snape gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort&#39;s coming back! Haven&#39;t you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won&#39;t be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He&#39;ll flatten it, or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn&#39;t matter anymore, can&#39;t you see? D&#39;you think he&#39;ll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I&#39;ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there, it&#39;s only dying a bit later than I would have, because I&#39;m never going over to the Dark Side! I&#39;m going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?&quot;<br /> <br /> He glared at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re right Harry,&quot; said Hermione in a small voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll use the invisibility cloak,&quot; said Harry. &quot;It&#39;s just lucky I got it back.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But will it cover all three of us?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;All -- all three of us?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, come off it, you don&#39;t think we&#39;d let you go alone?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course not,&quot; said Hermione briskly. &quot;How do you think you&#39;d get to the Stone without us? I&#39;d better go and took through my books, there might be something useful...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not if I can help it,&quot; said Hermione grimly. &quot;Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam. They&#39;re not throwing me out after that.&quot;<br /> <br /> After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had anything to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he hadn&#39;t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn&#39;t talk much. Both of them were thinking about what they were about to do.<br /> <br /> Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Better get the cloak,&quot; Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy -- he didn&#39;t feel much like singing.<br /> <br /> He ran back down to the common room.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all three of us - if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you doing?&quot; said a voice from the corner of the room. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the toad, who looked as though he&#39;d been making another bid for freedom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing, Neville, nothing,&quot; said Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back.<br /> <br /> Neville stared at their guilty faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re going out again,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, no, no,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;No, we&#39;re not. Why don&#39;t you go to bed, Neville?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn&#39;t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy to sleep.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can&#39;t go out,&quot; said Neville, &quot;you&#39;ll be caught again. Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Harry, &quot;this is important.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate.<br /> <br /> &quot;I won&#39;t let you do it,&quot; he said, hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole. &quot;I&#39;ll -- I&#39;ll fight you!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Neville, &quot;Ron exploded, &quot;get away from that hole and don&#39;t be an idiot--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t you call me an idiot!&quot; said Neville. I don&#39;t think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told me to stand up to people!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, but not to us,&quot; said Ron in exasperation. &quot;Neville, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;<br /> <br /> He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt out of sight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go on then, try and hit me!&quot; said Neville, raising his fists. &quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry turned to Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do something,&quot; he said desperately.<br /> <br /> Hermione stepped forward.<br /> <br /> &quot;Neville,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m really, really sorry about this.&quot;<br /> <br /> She raised her wand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Petrificus Totalus!&quot; she cried, pointing it at Neville.<br /> <br /> Neville&#39;s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face, stiff as a board.<br /> <br /> Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville&#39;s jaws were jammed together so he couldn&#39;t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at them in horror.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;ve you done to him?&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s the full Body-Bind,&quot; said Hermione miserably. &quot;Oh, Neville, I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We had to, Neville, no time to explain,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ll understand later, Neville,&quot; said Ron as they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak.<br /> <br /> But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn&#39;t feel like a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue&#39;s shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves swooping down on them. At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near the top.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, let&#39;s kick her, just this once,&quot; Ron whispered in Harry&#39;s ear, but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn&#39;t do anything.<br /> <br /> They didn&#39;t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the carpet so that people would trip.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. &quot;Know you&#39;re there, even if I can&#39;t see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?&quot;<br /> <br /> He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Should call Filch, I should, if something&#39;s a-creeping around unseen.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had a sudden idea.<br /> <br /> &quot;Peeves,&quot; he said, in a hoarse whisper, &quot;the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible.&quot;<br /> <br /> Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,&quot; he said greasily. &quot;My mistake, my mistake -- I didn&#39;t see you -- of course I didn&#39;t, you&#39;re invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I have business here, Peeves,&quot; croaked Harry. &quot;Stay away from this place tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I will, sir, I most certainly will,&quot; said Peeves, rising up in the air again. &quot;Hope your business goes well, Baron, I&#39;ll not bother you.&quot;<br /> <br /> And he scooted off.<br /> <br /> &quot;Brilliant, Harry!&quot; whispered Ron.<br /> <br /> A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor corridor -- and the door was already ajar.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, there you are,&quot; Harry said quietly, &quot;Snape&#39;s already got past Fluffy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry turned to the other two.<br /> <br /> &quot;If you want to go back, I won&#39;t blame you,&quot; he said. &quot;You can take the cloak, I won&#39;t need it now.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re coming,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> Harry pushed the door open.<br /> <br /> As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three of the dog&#39;s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even though it couldn&#39;t see them.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that at its feet?&quot; Hermione whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Looks like a harp,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Snape must have left it there.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It must wake up the moment you stop playing,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Well, here goes...&quot;<br /> <br /> He put Hagrid&#39;s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn&#39;t really a tune, but from the first note the beast&#39;s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog&#39;s growls ceased -- it tottered on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast asleep.<br /> <br /> &quot;Keep playing,&quot; Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog&#39;s hot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. &quot;I think we&#39;ll be able to pull the door open,&quot; said Ron, peering over the dog&#39;s back. &quot;Want to go first, Hermione?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, I don&#39;t!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right.&quot; Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog&#39;s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which swung up and open.<br /> <br /> &quot;What can you see?&quot; Hermione said anxiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing -- just black -- there&#39;s no way of climbing down, we&#39;ll just have to drop.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his attention and pointed at himself.<br /> <br /> &quot;You want to go first? Are you sure?&quot; said Ron. &quot;I don&#39;t know how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds&#39; silence, the dog growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it fell back into its deep sleep.<br /> <br /> Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. There was no sign of the bottom.<br /> <br /> He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, &quot;If anything happens to me, don&#39;t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;See you in a minute, I hope...&quot;<br /> <br /> And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell down, down, down and --<br /> <br /> FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s okay!&quot; he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp, which was the open trapdoor, &quot;it&#39;s a soft landing, you can jump!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s this stuff?&quot; were his first words.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it&#39;s here to break the fall. Come on, Hermione!&quot;<br /> <br /> The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry&#39;s other side.<br /> <br /> &quot;We must be miles under the school,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lucky this plant thing&#39;s here, really,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lucky!&quot; shrieked Hermione. &quot;Look at you both!&quot;<br /> <br /> She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing.<br /> <br /> Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the tighter and faster the plant wound around them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop moving!&quot; Hermione ordered them. &quot;I know what this is -- it&#39;s Devil&#39;s Snare!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so glad we know what it&#39;s called, that&#39;s a great help,&quot; snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck. &quot;Shut up, I&#39;m trying to remember how to kill it!&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, hurry up, I can&#39;t breathe!&quot; Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it curled around his chest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Devil&#39;s Snare, Devil&#39;s Snare... what did Professor Sprout say? -- it likes the dark and the damp.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So light a fire!&quot; Harry choked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes -- of course -- but there&#39;s no wood!&quot; Hermione cried, wringing her hands.<br /> <br /> &quot;HAVE YOU GONE MAD?&quot; Ron bellowed. &quot;ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, right!&quot; said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from their bodies, and they were able to pull free.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,&quot; said Harry as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; said Ron, &quot;and lucky Harry doesn&#39;t lose his head in a crisis -- &#39;there&#39;s no wood,&#39; honestly.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This way,&quot; said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which was the only way forward.<br /> <br /> All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards&#39; bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert had been bad enough...<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you hear something?&quot; Ron whispered.<br /> <br /> Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think it&#39;s a ghost?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know... sounds like wings to me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s light ahead -- I can see something moving.&quot;<br /> <br /> They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think they&#39;ll attack us if we cross the room?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Probably,&quot; said Harry. &quot;They don&#39;t look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down at once... well, there&#39;s no other choice... I&#39;ll run.&quot;<br /> <br /> He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked.<br /> <br /> The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the door, but it wouldn&#39;t budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;These birds... they can&#39;t be here just for decoration,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering -- glittering ?<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;re not birds!&quot; Harry said suddenly. &quot;They&#39;re keys! Winged keys -- look carefully. So that must mean... &quot; he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. &quot;... yes -- look! Broomsticks! We&#39;ve got to catch the key to the door!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But there are hundreds of them!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron examined the lock on the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re looking for a big, old-fashioned one -- probably silver, like the handle.&quot;<br /> <br /> They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched, but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one.<br /> <br /> Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn&#39;t. After a minute&#39;s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.<br /> <br /> &quot;That one!&quot; he called to the others. &quot;That big one -- there -- no, there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got to close in on it!&quot; Harry called, not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing. &quot;Ron, you come at it from above -- Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down and I&#39;ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione&#39;s cheers echoed around the high chamber.<br /> <br /> They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key struggling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned - it worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready?&quot; Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door handle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.<br /> <br /> The next chamber was so dark they couldn&#39;t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.<br /> <br /> They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly - the towering white chessmen had no faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what do we do?&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it?&quot; said Ron. &quot;We&#39;ve got to play our way across the room.&quot;<br /> <br /> Behind the white pieces they could see another door.<br /> <br /> &quot;How?&quot; said Hermione nervously.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think,&quot; said Ron, &quot;we&#39;re going to have to be chessmen.&quot;<br /> <br /> He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight&#39;s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across?&quot; The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.<br /> <br /> &quot;This needs thinking about... &quot; he said. &quot;I suppose we&#39;ve got to take the place of three of the black pieces...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, &quot;Now, don&#39;t be offended or anything, but neither of you are that good at chess--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re not offended,&quot; said Harry quickly. &quot;Just tell us what to do.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, you next to him instead of that castle.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What about you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m going to be a knight,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.<br /> <br /> &quot;White always plays first in chess,&quot; said Ron, peering across the board. &quot;Yes... look...&quot;<br /> <br /> A white pawn had moved forward two squares.<br /> <br /> Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry&#39;s knees were trembling. What if they lost?<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right.&quot;<br /> <br /> Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board, where he lay quite still, facedown.<br /> <br /> &quot;Had to let that happen,&quot; said Ron, looking shaken. &quot;Leaves you free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.&quot;<br /> <br /> Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re nearly there,&quot; he muttered suddenly. &quot;Let me think -- let me think...&quot;<br /> <br /> The white queen turned her blank face toward him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes... &quot; said Ron softly, &quot;It&#39;s the only way... I&#39;ve got to be taken.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;NO!&quot; Harry and Hermione shouted.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s chess!&quot; snapped Ron. &quot;You&#39;ve got to make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she&#39;ll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you want to stop Snape or not?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look, if you don&#39;t hurry up, he&#39;ll already have the Stone!&quot;<br /> <br /> There was no alternative.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready?&quot; Ron called, his face pale but determined. &quot;Here I go -- now, don&#39;t hang around once you&#39;ve won.&quot;<br /> <br /> He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the floor -- Hermione screamed but stayed on her square -- the white queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he&#39;d been knocked out.<br /> <br /> Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left.<br /> <br /> The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry&#39;s feet. They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.<br /> <br /> &quot;What if he&#39;s -- ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;ll be all right,&quot; said Harry, trying to convince himself. &quot;What do you reckon&#39;s next?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve had Sprout&#39;s, that was the Devil&#39;s Snare; Flitwick must&#39;ve put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive; that leaves Quirrell&#39;s spell, and Snape&#39;s.&quot;<br /> <br /> They had reached another door.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right?&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go on.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry pushed it open.<br /> <br /> A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m glad we didn&#39;t have to fight that one,&quot; Harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. &quot;Come on, I can&#39;t breathe.&quot;<br /> <br /> He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next -- but there was nothing very frightening in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape&#39;s,&quot; said Harry. &quot;What do we have to do?&quot;<br /> <br /> They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn&#39;t ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look!&quot; Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:<br /> <br /> Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,<br /> <br /> Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,<br /> <br /> One among us seven will let you move ahead,<br /> <br /> Another will transport the drinker back instead,<br /> <br /> Two among our number hold only nettle wine,<br /> <br /> Three of us are killers, waiting bidden in line.<br /> <br /> Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,<br /> <br /> To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:<br /> <br /> First, however slyly the poison tries to hide<br /> <br /> You will always find some on nettle wine&#39;s left side;<br /> <br /> Second, different are those who stand at either end,<br /> <br /> But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;<br /> <br /> Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,<br /> <br /> Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;<br /> <br /> Fourth, the second left and the second on the right<br /> <br /> Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.<br /> <br /> Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing.<br /> <br /> &quot;Brilliant,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;This isn&#39;t magic -- it&#39;s logic -- a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven&#39;t got an ounce of logic, they&#39;d be stuck in here forever.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But so will we, won&#39;t we?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course not,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Everything we need is here on this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back through the purple.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But how do we know which to drink?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Give me a minute.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them. At last, she clapped her hands.<br /> <br /> &quot;Got it,&quot; she said. &quot;The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked at the tiny bottle.<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s only enough there for one of us,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s hardly one swallow.&quot;<br /> <br /> They looked at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;Which one will get you back through the purple flames?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line.<br /> <br /> &quot;You drink that,&quot; said Harry. &quot;No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they&#39;ll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I&#39;m no match for him, really.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But Harry -- what if You-Know-Who&#39;s with him?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well -- I was lucky once, wasn&#39;t I?&quot; said Harry, pointing at his scar. &quot;I might get lucky again.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione&#39;s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and threw her arms around him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry -- you&#39;re a great wizard, you know.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not as good as you,&quot; said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let go of him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Me!&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Books! And cleverness! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You drink first,&quot; said Harry. &quot;You are sure which is which, aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Positive,&quot; said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round bottle at the end, and shuddered.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not poison?&quot; said Harry anxiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;No -- but it&#39;s like ice.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Quick, go, before it wears off.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good luck -- take care.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;GO!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.<br /> <br /> Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He turned to face the black flames.<br /> <br /> &quot;Here I come,&quot; he said, and he drained the little bottle in one gulp.<br /> <br /> It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black flames licking his body, but couldn&#39;t feel them -- for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire -- then he was on the other side, in the last chamber.<br /> <br /> There was already someone there -- but it wasn&#39;t Snape. It wasn&#39;t even Voldemort.</p> "

          "content": "<p> It was Quirrell.<br /> <br /> &quot;You!&quot; gasped Harry.<br /> <br /> Quirrell smiled. His face wasn&#39;t twitching at all.<br /> <br /> &quot;Me,&quot; he said calmly. &quot;I wondered whether I&#39;d be meeting you here, Potter.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I thought -- Snape--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Severus?&quot; Quirrell laughed, and it wasn&#39;t his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. &quot;Yes, Severus does seem the type, doesn&#39;t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t take it in. This couldn&#39;t be true, it couldn&#39;t.<br /> <br /> &quot;But Snape tried to kill me!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another few seconds and I&#39;d have got you off that broom. I&#39;d have managed it before then if Snape hadn&#39;t been muttering a countercurse, trying to save you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape was trying to save me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course,&quot; said Quirrell coolly. &quot;Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn&#39;t do it again. Funny, really... he needn&#39;t have bothered. I couldn&#39;t do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did make himself unpopular... and what a waste of time, when after all that, I&#39;m going to kill you tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that, for all I knew you&#39;d seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You let the troll in?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that three-headed dog didn&#39;t even manage to bite Snape&#39;s leg off properly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting mirror.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.<br /> <br /> &quot;This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,&quot; Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around the frame. &quot;Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this... but he&#39;s in London... I&#39;ll be far away by the time he gets back...&quot;<br /> <br /> All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror.<br /> <br /> &quot;I saw you and Snape in the forest -- &quot; he blurted out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at the back. &quot;He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far I&#39;d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me -- as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side...&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it.<br /> <br /> &quot;I see the Stone... I&#39;m presenting it to my master... but where is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn&#39;t give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror.<br /> <br /> &quot;But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, he does,&quot; said Quirrell casually, &quot;heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts with your father, didn&#39;t you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you...&quot;<br /> <br /> For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he said, &quot;I find it hard to follow my master&#39;s instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You mean he was there in the classroom with you?&quot; Harry gasped.<br /> <br /> &quot;He is with me wherever I go,&quot; said Quirrell quietly. &quot;I met him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it... Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had to be very hard on me.&quot; Quirrell shivered suddenly. &quot;He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me...&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell&#39;s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to Diagon Alley -- how could he have been so stupid? He&#39;d seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky Cauldron.<br /> <br /> Quirrell cursed under his breath.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t understand... is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I break it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s mind was racing.<br /> <br /> What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in the mirror, I should see myself finding it -- which means I&#39;ll see where it&#39;s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I&#39;m up to?<br /> <br /> He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking to himself.<br /> <br /> &quot;What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!&quot;<br /> <br /> And to Harry&#39;s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself.<br /> <br /> &quot;Use the boy... Use the boy...&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell rounded on Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes -- Potter -- come here.&quot;<br /> <br /> He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come here,&quot; Quirrell repeated. &quot;Look in the mirror and tell me what you see.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry walked toward him.<br /> <br /> I must lie, he thought desperately . I must look and lie about what I see, that&#39;s all.<br /> <br /> Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from Quirrell&#39;s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again.<br /> <br /> He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a moment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the Stone back in its pocket -- and as it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow -- incredibly -- he&#39;d gotten the Stone.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well?&quot; said Quirrell impatiently. &quot;What do you see?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry screwed up his courage.<br /> <br /> &quot;I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,&quot; he invented. &quot;I -- I&#39;ve won the house cup for Gryffindor.&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell cursed again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get out of the way,&quot; he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?<br /> <br /> But he hadn&#39;t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn&#39;t moving his lips.<br /> <br /> &quot;He lies... He lies...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, come back here!&quot; Quirrell shouted. &quot;Tell me the truth! What did you just see?&quot;<br /> <br /> The high voice spoke again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me speak to him... face-to-face...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Master, you are not strong enough!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I have strength enough... for this...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt as if Devil&#39;s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He couldn&#39;t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The turban fell away. Quirrell&#39;s head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly on the spot.<br /> <br /> Harry would have screamed, but he couldn&#39;t make a sound. Where there should have been a back to Quirrell&#39;s head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter... &quot; it whispered.<br /> <br /> Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn&#39;t move.<br /> <br /> &quot;See what I have become?&quot; the face said. &quot;Mere shadow and vapor... I have form only when I can share another&#39;s body... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own... Now... why don&#39;t you give me that Stone in your pocket?&quot;<br /> <br /> So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry&#39;s legs. He stumbled backward.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be a fool,&quot; snarled the face. &quot;Better save your own life and join me... or you&#39;ll meet the same end as your parents... They died begging me for mercy...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;LIAR!&quot; Harry shouted suddenly.<br /> <br /> Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could still see him. The evil face was now smiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;How touching... &quot; it hissed. &quot;I always value bravery... Yes, boy, your parents were brave... I killed your father first; and he put up a courageous fight... but your mother needn&#39;t have died... she was trying to protect you... Now give me the Stone, unless you want her to have died in vain.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;NEVER!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed &quot;SEIZE HIM!&quot; and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell&#39;s hand close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry&#39;s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of him. The pain in his head lessened -- he looked around wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in pain, looking at his fingers -- they were blistering before his eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Seize him! SEIZE HIM!&quot; shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet landing on top of him, both hands around Harry&#39;s neck -- Harry&#39;s scar was almost blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony.<br /> <br /> &quot;Master, I cannot hold him -- my hands -- my hands!&quot;<br /> <br /> And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms -- Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.<br /> <br /> &quot;Then kill him, fool, and be done!&quot; screeched Voldemort.<br /> <br /> Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell&#39;s face --<br /> <br /> &quot;AAAARGH!&quot;<br /> <br /> Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn&#39;t touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain -- his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.<br /> <br /> Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry off -- the pain in Harry&#39;s head was building -- he couldn&#39;t see -- he could only hear Quirrell&#39;s terrible shrieks and Voldemort&#39;s yells of, &quot;KILL HIM! KILL HIM!&quot; and other voices, maybe in Harry&#39;s own head, crying, &quot;Harry! Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> He felt Quirrell&#39;s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down... down... down...<br /> <br /> Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried to catch it, but his arms were too heavy.<br /> <br /> He blinked. It wasn&#39;t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. How strange.<br /> <br /> He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam into view above him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good afternoon, Harry,&quot; said Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: &quot;Sir! The Stone! It was Quirrell! He&#39;s got the Stone! Sir, quick--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;Quirrell does not have the Stone.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Then who does? Sir, I--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop.<br /> <br /> &quot;Tokens from your friends and admirers,&quot; said Dumbledore, beaming. &quot;What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How long have I been in here?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But sir, the Stone--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I must say.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You got there? You got Hermione&#39;s owl?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I feared I might be too late.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You nearly were, I couldn&#39;t have kept him off the Stone much longer -&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not the Stone, boy, you -- the effort involved nearly killed you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the Stone, it has been destroyed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Destroyed?&quot; said Harry blankly. &quot;But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, you know about Nicolas?&quot; said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. &quot;You did do the thing properly, didn&#39;t you? Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it&#39;s all for the best.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But that means he and his wife will die, won&#39;t they?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;To one as young as you, I&#39;m sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sir?&quot; said Harry. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking... sir -- even if the Stone&#39;s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort&#39;s going to try other ways of coming back, isn&#39;t he? I mean, he hasn&#39;t gone, has he?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking for another body to share... not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, &quot;Sir, there are some other things I&#39;d like to know, if you can tell me... things I want to know the truth about...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The truth.&quot; Dumbledore sighed. &quot;It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to, in which case I beg you&#39;ll forgive me. I shall not, of course, lie.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.<br /> <br /> &quot;Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day... put it from your mind for now, Harry. When you are older... I know you hate to hear this... when you are ready, you will know.&quot;<br /> <br /> And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.<br /> <br /> &quot;But why couldn&#39;t Quirrell touch me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn&#39;t realize that love as powerful as your mother&#39;s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, &quot;And the invisibility cloak -- do you know who sent it to me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah -- your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I thought you might like it.&quot; Dumbledore&#39;s eyes twinkled. &quot;Useful things... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And there&#39;s something else...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Fire away.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Quirrell said Snape--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Snape, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He saved his life.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes... &quot; said Dumbledore dreamily. &quot;Funny, the way people&#39;s minds work, isn&#39;t it? Professor Snape couldn&#39;t bear being in your father&#39;s debt... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating your father&#39;s memory in peace...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.<br /> <br /> &quot;And sir, there&#39;s one more thing...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just the one?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, now, I&#39;m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that&#39;s saying something. You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it, but not use it -- would be able to get it, otherwise they&#39;d just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make a start on these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott&#39;s Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I&#39;ll be safe with a nice toffee, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. Then he choked and said, &quot;Alas! Ear wax!&quot;<br /> <br /> Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just five minutes,&quot; Harry pleaded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Absolutely not.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You let Professor Dumbledore in...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You need rest.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, very well,&quot; she said. &quot;But five minutes only.&quot;<br /> <br /> And she let Ron and Hermione in.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The whole school&#39;s talking about it,&quot; said Ron. &quot;What really happened?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell&#39;s turban, Hermione screamed out loud.<br /> <br /> &quot;So the Stone&#39;s gone?&quot; said Ron finally. &quot;Flamel&#39;s just going to die ?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it? -- &#39;to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I always said he was off his rocker,&quot; said Ron, looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero was.<br /> <br /> &quot;So what happened to you two?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I got back all right,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said, &#39;Harry&#39;s gone after him, hasn&#39;t he?&#39; and hurtled off to the third floor.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think he meant you to do it?&quot; said Ron. &quot;Sending you your father&#39;s cloak and everything?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well,&quot; Hermione exploded, &quot;if he did -- I mean to say that&#39;s terrible -- you could have been killed.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, it isn&#39;t,&quot; said Harry thoughtfully. &quot;He&#39;s a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don&#39;t think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It&#39;s almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, Dumbledore&#39;s off his rocker, all right,&quot; said Ron proudly. &quot;Listen, you&#39;ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food&#39;ll be good.&quot;<br /> <br /> At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT&quot; she said firmly.<br /> <br /> After a good night&#39;s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to go to the feast,&quot; he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes. &quot;I can, can&#39;t I?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,&quot; she said stiffly, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn&#39;t realize how risky feasts could be. &quot;And you have another visitor.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, good,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault!&quot; he sobbed, his face in his hands. I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the only thing he didn&#39;t know, an&#39; I told him! Yeh could&#39;ve died! All fer a dragon egg! I&#39;ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an&#39; made ter live as a Muggle!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot; said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. &quot;Hagrid, he&#39;d have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we&#39;re talking about, he&#39;d have found out even if you hadn&#39;t told him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh could&#39;ve died!&quot; sobbed Hagrid. &quot;An&#39; don&#39; say the name!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;VOLDEMORT!&quot; Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. &quot;I&#39;ve met him and I&#39;m calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it&#39;s gone, he can&#39;t use it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I&#39;ve got loads...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, &quot;That reminds me. I&#39;ve got yeh a present.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not a stoat sandwich, is it?&quot; said Harry anxiously, and at last Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. &#39;course, he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway, got yeh this...&quot;<br /> <br /> It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sent owls off ter all yer parents&#39; old school friends, askin&#39; fer photos... knew yeh didn&#39; have any... d&#39;yeh like it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t speak, but Hagrid understood.<br /> <br /> Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey&#39;s fussing about, insisting on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to celebrate Slytherin&#39;s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the High Table.<br /> <br /> When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat between Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.<br /> <br /> Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble died away.<br /> <br /> &quot;Another year gone!&quot; Dumbledore said cheerfully. &quot;And I must trouble you with an old man&#39;s wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts...<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, as I understand it, the house cup here needs awarding, and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.&quot;<br /> <br /> A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the table. It was a sickening sight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;However, recent events must be taken into account.&quot;<br /> <br /> The room went very still. The Slytherins&#39; smiles faded a little.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ahem,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;I have a few last-minute points to dish out. Let me see. Yes...<br /> <br /> &quot;First -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley...&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn.<br /> <br /> &quot;... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.&quot;<br /> <br /> Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other prefects, &quot;My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall&#39;s giant chess set!&quot;<br /> <br /> At last there was silence again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Second -- to Miss Hermione Granger... for the use of cool logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves -- they were a hundred points up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Third -- to Mr. Harry Potter... &quot; said Dumbledore. The room went deadly quiet. &quot;... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.&quot;<br /> <br /> The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy-two points -- exactly the same as Slytherin. They had tied for the house cup -- if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.<br /> <br /> &quot;There are all kinds of courage,&quot; said Dumbledore, smiling. &quot;It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.&quot;<br /> <br /> Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn&#39;t have looked more stunned and horrified if he&#39;d just had the Body-Bind Curse put on him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Which means,&quot; Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of Slytherin, &quot;we need a little change of decoration.&quot;<br /> <br /> He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall&#39;s hand, with a horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry&#39;s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape&#39;s feelings toward him hadn&#39;t changed one jot. This didn&#39;t worry Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.<br /> <br /> It was the best evening of Harry&#39;s life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls... he would never, ever forget tonight.<br /> <br /> Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron said, you couldn&#39;t have everything in life.<br /> <br /> And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville&#39;s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use magic over the holidays (&quot;I always hope they&#39;ll forget to give us these,&quot; said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott&#39;s Every Flavor Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine and three-quarters at King&#39;s Cross Station.<br /> <br /> It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go through the gate in twos and threes so they didn&#39;t attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles.<br /> <br /> &quot;You must come and stay this summer,&quot; said Ron, &quot;both of you -- I&#39;ll send you an owl.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Thanks,&quot; said Harry, &quot;I&#39;ll need something to look forward to.&quot; People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:<br /> <br /> &quot;Bye, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;See you, Potter!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Still famous,&quot; said Ron, grinning at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not where I&#39;m going, I promise you,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together. &quot;There he is, Mom, there he is, look!&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Ginny Weasley, Ron&#39;s younger sister, but she wasn&#39;t pointing at Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter!&quot; she squealed. &quot;Look, Mom! I can see--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Be quiet, Ginny, and it&#39;s rude to point.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Busy year?&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Very,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs. Weasley.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, it was nothing, dear.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready, are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still looking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You must be Harry&#39;s family!&quot; said Mrs. Weasley.<br /> <br /> &quot;In a manner of speaking,&quot; said Uncle Vernon. &quot;Hurry up, boy, we haven&#39;t got all day.&quot; He walked away.<br /> <br /> Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;See you over the summer, then.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday,&quot; said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, I will,&quot; said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that was spreading over his face. &quot;They don&#39;t know we&#39;re not allowed to use magic at home. I&#39;m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this summer...</p> "

          "content": "<p> Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry&#39;s room.<br /> <br /> &quot;Third time this week!&quot; he roared across the table. &quot;If you can&#39;t control that owl, it&#39;ll have to go!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried, yet again, to explain.<br /> <br /> &quot;She&#39;s bored ,&quot; he said. &quot;She&#39;s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out at night--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do I look stupid?&quot; snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy mustache. &quot;I know what&#39;ll happen if that owl&#39;s let out.&quot;<br /> <br /> He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.<br /> <br /> Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursleys&#39; son, Dudley.<br /> <br /> &quot;I want more bacon.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s more in the frying pan, sweetums,&quot; said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. &quot;We must build you up while we&#39;ve got the chance... I don&#39;t like the sound of that school food...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,&quot; said Uncle Vernon heartily. &quot;Dudley gets enough, don&#39;t you, son?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Pass the frying pan.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve forgotten the magic word,&quot; said Harry irritably.<br /> <br /> The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples.<br /> <br /> &quot;I meant please&#39;!&quot; said Harry quickly. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,&quot; thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, &quot;ABOUT SAYING THE M&#39;WORD IN OUR HOUSE?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!&quot; roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.<br /> <br /> &quot;I just--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right,&quot; said Harry, &quot; all right...&quot;<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.<br /> <br /> Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn&#39;t a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.<br /> <br /> Harry Potter was a wizard - a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.<br /> <br /> He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).<br /> <br /> All Harry&#39;s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn&#39;t practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry&#39;s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.<br /> <br /> Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.<br /> <br /> It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry&#39;s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys&#39;doorstep eleven years before.<br /> <br /> At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry&#39;s parents had died in Voldemort&#39;s attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow - nobody understood why -Voldemort&#39;s powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.<br /> <br /> So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother&#39;s sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys&#39;story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.<br /> <br /> And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous... but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.<br /> <br /> The Dursleys hadn&#39;t even remembered that today happened to be Harry&#39;s twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn&#39;t been high; they&#39;d never given him a real present, let alone a cake - but to ignore it completely...<br /> <br /> At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, &quot;Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.<br /> <br /> &quot;This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,&quot; said Uncle Vernon.<br /> <br /> Harry went back to his toast. Of course , he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party . He&#39;d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon&#39;s company made drills).<br /> <br /> &quot;I think we should run through the schedule one more time,&quot; said Uncle Vernon. &quot;We should all be in position at eight o&#39;clock. Petunia, you will be -?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;In the lounge,&quot; said Aunt Petunia promptly, &quot;waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good, good. And Dudley?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be waiting to open the door.&quot; Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. &quot;May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;ll love him!&quot; cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excellent, Dudley,&quot; said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. &quot;And you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I&#39;m not there,&quot; said Harry tonelessly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Exactly,&quot; said Uncle Vernon nastily. &quot;I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll announce dinner,&quot; said Aunt Petunia.<br /> <br /> &quot;And, Dudley, you&#39;ll say--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?&quot; said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.<br /> <br /> &quot;My perfect little gentleman!&quot; sniffed Aunt Petunia.<br /> <br /> &quot;And you?&quot; said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I&#39;m not there,&quot; said Harry dully.<br /> <br /> &quot;Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Vernon tells me you&#39;re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Perfect... Dudley?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How about - &#39;We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you .&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn&#39;t see him laughing.<br /> <br /> &quot;And you, boy?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I&#39;m not there,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Too right, you will.&quot; said Uncle Vernon forcefully. &quot;The Masons don&#39;t know anything about you and it&#39;s going to stay that way. When dinner&#39;s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I&#39;ll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I&#39;ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to morrow.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t feel too excited about this. He didn&#39;t think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.<br /> <br /> &quot;Right - I&#39;m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you ,&quot; he snarled at Harry. &quot;You stay out of your aunt&#39;s way while she&#39;s cleaning.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:<br /> <br /> &quot;Happy birthday to me... happy birthday to me...&quot;<br /> <br /> No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn&#39;t seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.<br /> <br /> Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig&#39;s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn&#39;t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren&#39;t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn&#39;t told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.<br /> <br /> What wouldn&#39;t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He&#39;d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn&#39;t all been a dream...<br /> <br /> Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort&#39;s clutches for a second time, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes--<br /> <br /> Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back . Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.<br /> <br /> Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know what day it is,&quot; sang Dudley, waddling toward him.<br /> <br /> The huge eyes blinked and vanished.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know what day it is,&quot; Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well done,&quot; said Harry. &quot;So you&#39;ve finally learned the days of the week.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Today&#39;s your birthday ,&quot; sneered Dudley. &quot;How come you haven&#39;t got any cards? Haven&#39;t you even got friends at that freak place?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,&quot; said Harry coolly.<br /> <br /> Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why&#39;re you staring at the hedge?&quot; he said suspiciously.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.<br /> <br /> &quot;You c-can&#39;t - Dad told you you&#39;re not to do m-magic - he said he&#39;ll chuck you out of the house - and you haven&#39;t got anywhere else to go - you haven&#39;t got any friends to take you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Jiggery pokery!&quot; said Harry in a fierce voice. &quot; Hocus pocus - squiggly wiggly - &quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;MUUUUUUM!&quot; howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. &quot;MUUUUM! He&#39;s doing you know what!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn&#39;t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he wouldn&#39;t eat again until he&#39;d finished.<br /> <br /> While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn&#39;t have risen to Dudley&#39;s bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn&#39;t have any friends at Hogwarts...<br /> <br /> Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now , he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.<br /> <br /> It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight&#39;s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.<br /> <br /> &quot;Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!&quot; snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress.<br /> <br /> Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. &quot;Upstairs! Hurry!&quot;<br /> <br /> As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon&#39;s furious face appeared at the foot of the stairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Remember, boy - one sound--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.</p> "

          "content": "<p> Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that morning.<br /> <br /> As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley&#39;s voice from the hall.<br /> <br /> &quot;May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?&quot;<br /> <br /> The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er - hello,&quot; said Harry nervously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter!&quot; said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry down the stairs. &quot;So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir... Such an honor it is...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Th-thank you,&quot; said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, &quot;What are you?&quot; but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, &quot;Who are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,&quot; said the creature.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh - really?&quot; said Harry. &quot;Er - I don&#39;t want to be rude or anything, but - this isn&#39;t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.&quot;<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not that I&#39;m not pleased to meet you,&quot; said Harry quickly, &quot;but, er, is there any particular reason you&#39;re here?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yes, sir,&quot; said Dobby earnestly. &quot;Dobby has come to tell you, sir... it is difficult, sir... Dobby wonders where to begin...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Sit down,&quot; said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.<br /> <br /> To his horror, the elf burst into tears - very noisy tears.<br /> <br /> &quot;S-sit down!&quot; he wailed. &quot; Never ... never ever...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he whispered, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you or anything--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Offend Dobby!&quot; choked the elf. &quot;Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, trying to say &quot;Shh!&quot; and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery adoration.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can&#39;t have met many decent wizards,&quot; said Harry, trying to cheer him up.<br /> <br /> Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head furiously on the window, shouting, &quot; Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t - what are you doing?&quot; Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto the bed - Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby had to punish himself, sir,&quot; said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed. &quot;Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Your family?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The wizard family Dobby serves, sir... Dobby is a house-elf - bound to serve one house and one family forever...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Do they know you&#39;re here?&quot; asked Harry curiously.<br /> <br /> Dobby shuddered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no, sir, no... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew, sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But won&#39;t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But why don&#39;t you leave? Escape?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free... Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stared.<br /> <br /> &quot;And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,&quot; he said. &quot;This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can&#39;t anyone help you? Can&#39;t I?&quot;<br /> <br /> Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn&#39;t spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of gratitude.<br /> <br /> &quot;Please,&quot; Harry whispered frantically, &quot;please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything, if they know you&#39;re here--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby... Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, &quot;Whatever you&#39;ve heard about my greatness is a load of rubbish. I&#39;m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that&#39;s Hermione, she--&quot;<br /> <br /> But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter is humble and modest,&quot; said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow. &quot;Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Voldemort?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, &quot;Ah, speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Harry quickly. &quot;I know lots of people don&#39;t like it. My friend Ron--&quot;<br /> <br /> He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.<br /> <br /> Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby heard tell,&quot; he said hoarsely, &quot;that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago... that Harry Potter escaped yet again .&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nodded and Dobby&#39;s eyes suddenly shone with tears.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, sir,&quot; he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was wearing. &quot;Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears in the oven door later... Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts .&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon&#39;s voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;W-what?&quot; Harry stammered. &quot;But I&#39;ve got to go back - term starts on September first. It&#39;s all that&#39;s keeping me going. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like here. I don&#39;t belong here. I belong in your world - at Hogwarts.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, no, no,&quot; squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. &quot;Harry Potter must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why?&quot; said Harry in surprise.<br /> <br /> &quot;There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,&quot; whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. &quot;Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He is too important, sir!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What terrible things?&quot; said Harry at once. &quot;Who&#39;s plotting them?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the wall.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right!&quot; cried Harry, grabbing the elf&#39;s arm to stop him. &quot;You can&#39;t tell me. I understand. But why are you warning me?&quot; A sudden, unpleasant thought struck him. &quot;Hang on - this hasn&#39;t got anything to do with Vol- - sorry - with You-Know-Who, has it? You could just shake or nod,&quot; he added hastily as Dobby&#39;s head tilted worryingly close to the wall again.<br /> <br /> Slowly, Dobby shook his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not - not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named , sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Dobby&#39;s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give Harry a hint. Harry, however, was completely lost.<br /> <br /> &quot;He hasn&#39;t got a brother, has he?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well then, I can&#39;t think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I mean, there&#39;s Dumbledore, for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby bowed his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore&#39;s powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength. But, sir&quot; - Dobby&#39;s voice dropped to an urgent whisper - &quot;there are powers Dumbledore doesn&#39;t... powers no decent wizard...&quot;<br /> <br /> And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, seized Harry&#39;s desk lamp, and started beating himself around the head with earsplitting yelps.<br /> <br /> A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, &quot;Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Quick! In the closet!&quot; hissed Harry, stuffing Dobby in, shutting the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle turned.<br /> <br /> &quot;What - the - devil - are - you - doing?&quot; said Uncle Vernon through gritted teeth, his face horribly close to Harry&#39;s. &quot;You&#39;ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke... One more sound and you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d never been born, boy!&quot;<br /> <br /> He stomped flat-footed from the room.<br /> <br /> Shaking, Harry let Dobby out of the closet.<br /> <br /> &quot;See what it&#39;s like here?&quot; he said. &quot;See why I&#39;ve got to go back to Hogwarts? It&#39;s the only place I&#39;ve got - well, I think I&#39;ve got friends.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Friends who don&#39;t even write to Harry Potter?&quot; said Dobby slyly.<br /> <br /> &quot;I expect they&#39;ve just been - wait a minute,&quot; said Harry, frowning. &quot;How do you know my friends haven&#39;t been writing to me?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby shuffled his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter mustn&#39;t be angry with Dobby. Dobby did it for the best--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you been stopping my letters? &quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby has them here, sir,&quot; said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of Harry&#39;s reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione&#39;s neat writing, Ron&#39;s untidy scrawl, and even a scribble that looked as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid.<br /> <br /> Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter mustn&#39;t be angry... Dobby hoped... if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him... Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry wasn&#39;t listening. He made a grab for the letters, but Dobby jumped out of reach.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter will have them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you must not face! Say you won&#39;t go back, sir!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry angrily. &quot;Give me my friends&#39;letters!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,&quot; said the elf sadly.<br /> <br /> Before Harry could move, Dobby had darted to the bedroom door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs.<br /> <br /> Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Harry sprang after him, trying not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike on the hall carpet, looking around for Dobby. From the dining room he heard Uncle Vernon saying, &quot;... tell Petunia that very funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She&#39;s been dying to hear...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry ran up the hall into the kitchen and felt his stomach disappear.<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunia&#39;s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream and sugared violets, was floating up near the ceiling. On top of a cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; croaked Harry. &quot;Please... they&#39;ll kill me...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter must say he&#39;s not going back to school--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby... please...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Say it, sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I can&#39;t--&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby gave him a tragic look.<br /> <br /> &quot;Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter&#39;s own good.&quot;<br /> <br /> The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a crack like a whip, Dobby vanished.<br /> <br /> There were screams from the dining room and Uncle Vernon burst into the kitchen to find Harry, rigid with shock, covered from head to foot in Aunt Petunia&#39;s pudding.<br /> <br /> At first, it looked as though Uncle Vernon would manage to gloss the whole thing over. (&quot;Just our nephew -very disturbed - meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs...&quot;) He shooed the shocked Masons back into the dining room, promised Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Masons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing the kitchen clean.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal - if it hadn&#39;t been for the owl.<br /> <br /> Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason&#39;s head, and swooped out again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell the Dursleys that his wife was mortally afraid of birds of all shapes and sizes, and to ask whether this was their idea of a joke.<br /> <br /> Harry stood in the kitchen, clutching the mop for support, as Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Read it!&quot; he hissed evilly, brandishing the letter the owl had delivered. &quot;Go on - read it!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings.<br /> <br /> Dear Mr. Potter,<br /> <br /> We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was used at your place of residence this evening at twelve minutes past nine.<br /> <br /> As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to perform spells outside school, and further spellwork on your part may lead to expulsion from said school. (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery, 1875, Paragraph C).<br /> <br /> We would also ask you to remember that any magical activity that risks notice by members of the non magical community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 of the International Confederation of Warlocks&#39;Statute of Secrecy.<br /> <br /> Enjoy your holidays!<br /> <br /> Yours sincerely,<br /> <br /> Mafalda Hopkirk<br /> <br /> IMPROPER USE OF MAGIC OFFICE<br /> <br /> Ministry of Magic<br /> <br /> Harry looked up from the letter and gulped.<br /> <br /> &quot;You didn&#39;t tell us you weren&#39;t allowed to use magic outside school,&quot; said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. &quot;Forgot to mention it... Slipped your mind, I daresay...&quot;<br /> <br /> He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth bared. &quot;Well, I&#39;ve got news for you, boy... I&#39;m locking you up... You&#39;re never going back to that school... never... and if you try and magic yourself out - they&#39;ll expel you!&quot;<br /> <br /> And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon was as bad as his word. The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry&#39;s window. He himself fitted a cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day. They let Harry out to use the bathroom morning and evening. Otherwise, he was locked in his room around the clock.<br /> <br /> Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn&#39;t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his bed watching the sun sinking behind the bars on the window and wondered miserably what was going to happen to him.<br /> <br /> What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren&#39;t going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but the way things were going, he&#39;d probably starve to death anyway.<br /> <br /> The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the room to Hedwig&#39;s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers and gave him a look of deep disgust.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s no good turning your beak up at it - that&#39;s all we&#39;ve got,&quot; said Harry grimly.<br /> <br /> He put the empty bowl back on the floor next to the cat-flap and lay back down on the bed, somehow even hungrier than he had been before the soup.<br /> <br /> Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, hat would happen if he didn&#39;t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent to see why he hadn&#39;t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go?<br /> <br /> The room was growing dark. Exhausted, stomach rumbling, mind spinning over the same unanswerable questions, Harry fell into an uneasy sleep.<br /> <br /> He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading UNDERAGE WIZARD attached to his cage. People goggled through the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He saw Dobby&#39;s face in the crowd and shouted out, asking for help, but Dobby called, &quot;Harry Potter is safe there, sir!&quot; and vanished. Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the cage, laughing at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop it,&quot; Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore head. &quot;Leave me alone... cut it out... I&#39;m trying to sleep...&quot;<br /> <br /> He opened his eyes. Moonlight was shining through the bars on the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone.<br /> <br /> Ron Weasley was outside Harry&#39;s window.</p> "

          "content": "<p> &quot;Ron.&quot; breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it up so they could talk through the bars. &quot;Ron, how did you -? What the -?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was seeing hit him. Ron was leaning out of the back window of an old turquoise car, which was parked in midair . Grinning at Harry from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron&#39;s elder twin brothers.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, Harry?&quot; asked George.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s been going on?&quot; said Ron. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you been answering my letters? I&#39;ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you&#39;d got an official warning for using magic in front of Muggles--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It wasn&#39;t me - and how did he know?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He works for the Ministry,&quot; said Ron. &quot;You know we&#39;re not supposed to do spells outside school--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You should talk,&quot; said Harry, staring at the floating car.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, this doesn&#39;t count,&quot; said Ron. &quot;We&#39;re only borrowing this. It&#39;s Dad&#39;s, we didn&#39;t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I told you, I didn&#39;t - but it&#39;ll take too long to explain now - look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and won&#39;t let me come back, and obviously I can&#39;t magic myself out, because the Ministry&#39;ll think that&#39;s the second spell I&#39;ve done in three days, so--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop gibbering,&quot; said Ron. &quot;We&#39;ve come to take you home with us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But you can&#39;t magic me out either--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We don&#39;t need to,&quot; said Ron, jerking his head toward the front seat and grinning. &quot;You forget who I&#39;ve got with me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Tie that around the bars,&quot; said Fred, throwing the end of a rope to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;If the Dursleys wake up, I&#39;m dead,&quot; said Harry as he tied the rope tightly around a bar and Fred revved up the car.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Fred, &quot;and stand back.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry moved back into the shadows next to Hedwig, who seemed to have realized how important this was and kept still and silent. The car revved louder and louder and suddenly, with a crunching noise, the bars were pulled clean out of the window as Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron hoisted them up into the car. Harry listened anxiously, but there was no sound from the Dursleys&#39;bedroom.<br /> <br /> When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred reversed as close as possible to Harry&#39;s window.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get in,&quot; Ron said.<br /> <br /> &quot;But all my Hogwarts stuff - my wand - my broomstick--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Where is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, and I can&#39;t get out of this room--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No problem,&quot; said George from the front passenger seat. &quot;Out of the way, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into Harry&#39;s room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to pick the lock.<br /> <br /> &quot;A lot of wizards think it&#39;s a waste of time, knowing this sort of Muggle trick,&quot; said Fred, &quot;but we feel they&#39;re skills worth learning, even if they are a bit slow.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a small click and the door swung open.<br /> <br /> &quot;So - we&#39;ll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron,&quot; whispered George.<br /> <br /> &quot;Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks,&quot; Harry whispered back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing.<br /> <br /> Harry dashed around his room, collecting his things and passing them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon cough.<br /> <br /> At last, panting, they reached the landing, then carried the trunk through Harry&#39;s room to the open window. Fred climbed back into the car to pull with Ron, and Harry and George pushed from the bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window.<br /> <br /> Uncle Vernon coughed again.<br /> <br /> &quot;A bit more,&quot; panted Fred, who was pulling from inside the car. &quot;One good push--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.<br /> <br /> &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go,&quot; George whispered.<br /> <br /> But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden loud screech from behind him, followed immediately by the thunder of Uncle Vernon&#39;s voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;THAT RUDDY OWL!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve forgotten Hedwig!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked on - he snatched up Hedwig&#39;s cage, dashed to the window, and passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of drawers when Uncle Vernon hammered on the unlocked door - and it crashed open.<br /> <br /> For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, grabbing him by the ankle.<br /> <br /> Ron, Fred, and George seized Harry&#39;s arms and pulled as hard as they could.<br /> <br /> &quot;Petunia!&quot; roared Uncle Vernon. &quot;He&#39;s getting away! HE&#39;S GETTING AWAY!&quot;<br /> <br /> But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry&#39;s leg slid out of Uncle Vernon&#39;s grasp - Harry was in the car - he&#39;d slammed the door shut--<br /> <br /> &quot;Put your foot down, Fred!&quot; yelled Ron, and the car shot suddenly toward the moon.<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t believe it - he was free. He rolled down the window, the night air whipping his hair, and looked back at the shrinking rooftops of Privet Drive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry&#39;s window.<br /> <br /> &quot;See you next summer!&quot; Harry yelled.<br /> <br /> The Weasleys roared with laughter and Harry settled back in his seat, grinning from ear to ear.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let Hedwig out,&quot; he told Ron. &quot;She can fly behind us. She hasn&#39;t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.&quot;<br /> <br /> George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a ghost.<br /> <br /> &quot;So - what&#39;s the story, Harry?&quot; said Ron impatiently. &quot;What&#39;s been happening?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he&#39;d given Harry and the fiasco of the violet pudding. There was a long, shocked silence when he had finished.<br /> <br /> &quot;Very fishy,&quot; said Fred finally.<br /> <br /> &quot;Definitely dodgy&quot; agreed George. &quot;So he wouldn&#39;t even tell you who&#39;s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t think he could,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I told you, every time he got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head against the wall.&quot;<br /> <br /> He saw Fred and George look at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;What, you think he was lying to me?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well,&quot; said Fred, &quot;put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own, but they can&#39;t usually use it without their master&#39;s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you coming back to Hogwarts. Someone&#39;s idea of a joke. Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry and Ron together, instantly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Draco Malfoy,&quot; Harry explained. &quot;He hates me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Draco Malfoy?&quot; said George, turning around. &quot;Not Lucius Malfoy&#39;s son?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Must be, it&#39;s not a very common name, is it?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve heard Dad talking about him,&quot; said George. &quot;He was a big supporter of You-Know-Who.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And when You-Know-Who disappeared,&quot; said Fred, craning around to look at Harry, &quot;Lucius Malfoy came back saying he&#39;d never meant any of it. Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You- Know-Who&#39;s inner circle.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy&#39;s family before, and they didn&#39;t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy...<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf...&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and they&#39;ll be rich,&quot; said Fred.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, Mum&#39;s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,&quot; said George. &quot;But all we&#39;ve got is a lousy old ghoul in the attic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn&#39;t catch one in our house...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously?<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m glad we came to get you, anyway,&quot; said Ron. &quot;I was getting really worried when you didn&#39;t answer any of my letters. I thought it was Errol&#39;s fault at first--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s Errol?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Our owl. He&#39;s ancient. It wouldn&#39;t be the first time he&#39;d collapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made prefect,&quot; said Fred from the front.<br /> <br /> &quot;But Percy wouldn&#39;t lend him to me,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Said he needed him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Percy&#39;s been acting very oddly this summer,&quot; said George, frowning. &quot;And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a load of time shut up in his room... I mean, there&#39;s only so many times you can polish a prefect badge... You&#39;re driving too far west, Fred,&quot; he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. Fred twiddled the steering wheel.<br /> <br /> &quot;So, does your dad know you&#39;ve got the car?&quot; said Harry, guessing the answer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er, no,&quot; said Ron, &quot;he had to work tonight. Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He works in the most boring department,&quot; said Ron. &quot;The Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The what?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s all to do with bewitching things that are Muggle-made, you know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an antiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare - Dad was working overtime for weeks.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What happened?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place and one man ended up in the hospital with the sugar tongs clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic - it&#39;s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in the office - and they had to do Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But your dad - this car--&quot;<br /> <br /> Fred laughed. &quot;Yeah, Dad&#39;s crazy about everything to do with Muggles; our shed&#39;s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house he&#39;d have to put himself under arrest. It drives Mum mad.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s the main road,&quot; said George, peering down through the windshield. &quot;We&#39;ll be there in ten minutes... Just as well, it&#39;s getting light...&quot;<br /> <br /> A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east.<br /> <br /> Fred brought the car lower, and Harry saw a dark patchwork of fields and clumps of trees.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re a little way outside the village,&quot; said George. &quot;Ottery St. Catchpole.&quot;<br /> <br /> Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun was now gleaming through the trees.<br /> <br /> &quot;Touchdown!&quot; said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and Harry looked out for the first time at Ron&#39;s house.<br /> <br /> It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW . Around the front door lay a jumble of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not much,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s wonderful ,&quot; said Harry happily, thinking of Privet Drive.<br /> <br /> They got out of the car.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, we&#39;ll go upstairs really quietly,&quot; said Fred, &quot;and wait for Mum to call us for breakfast Then, Ron, you come bounding downstairs going, Mum, look who turned up in the night!&#39;and she&#39;ll be all pleased to see Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. The other three wheeled around.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah , &quot;said Fred.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said George.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket.<br /> <br /> &quot;So ,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Morning, Mum,&quot; said George, in what he clearly thought was a jaunty, winning voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you any idea how worried I&#39;ve been?&quot; said Mrs. Weasley in a deadly whisper.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to--&quot;<br /> <br /> All three of Mrs. Weasley&#39;s sons were taller than she was, but they cowered as her rage broke over them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Beds empty! No note! Car gone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care? - never, as long as I&#39;ve lived - you wait until your father gets home, we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy -&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Perfect Percy,&quot; muttered Fred.<br /> <br /> &quot;YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY&#39;S BOOK!&quot; yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred&#39;s chest. &quot;You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job--&quot;<br /> <br /> It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,&quot; she said. &quot;Come in and have some breakfast.&quot;<br /> <br /> She turned and walked back into the house and Harry, after a nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her.<br /> <br /> The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard house before.<br /> <br /> The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens , and You&#39;re late . Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It&#39;s Magic! And unless Harry&#39;s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was &quot;Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like &quot;don&#39;t know what you were thinking of,&quot; and &quot; never would have believed it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t blame you , dear,&quot; she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his plate. &quot;Arthur and I have been worried about you, too. Just last night we were saying we&#39;d come and get you ourselves if you hadn&#39;t written back to Ron by Friday. But really,&quot; (she was now adding three fried eggs to his plate) &quot;flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you--&quot;<br /> <br /> She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to clean themselves, clinking gently in the background.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was cloudy , Mum!&quot; said Fred.<br /> <br /> &quot;You keep your mouth closed while you&#39;re eating!&quot; Mrs. Weasley snapped.<br /> <br /> &quot;They were starving him, Mum!&quot; said George.<br /> <br /> &quot;And you!&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for him.<br /> <br /> At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ginny,&quot; said Ron in an undertone to Harry. &quot;My sister. She&#39;s been talking about you all summer.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, she&#39;ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,&quot; Fred said with a grin, but he caught his mother&#39;s eye and bent his face over his plate without another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time.<br /> <br /> &quot;Blimey , I&#39;m tired,&quot; yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. &quot;I think I&#39;ll go to bed and--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You will not,&quot; snapped Mrs. Weasley. &quot;It&#39;s your own fault you&#39;ve been up all night. You&#39;re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they&#39;re getting completely out of hand again--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Mum--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And you two,&quot; she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. &quot;You can go up to bed, dear,&quot; she added to Harry. &quot;You didn&#39;t ask them to fly that wretched car--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, &quot;I&#39;ll help Ron. I&#39;ve never seen a de-gnoming--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s very sweet of you, dear, but it&#39;s dull work,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley. &quot;Now, let&#39;s see what Lockhart&#39;s got to say on the subject--&quot;<br /> <br /> And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. George groaned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley&#39;s book. Written across it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s Guide to Household Pests . There was a big photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, he is marvelous,&quot; she said. &quot;He knows his household pests, all right, it&#39;s a wonderful book...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Mum fancies him,&quot; said Fred, in a very audible whisper.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be so ridiculous, Fred,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. &quot;All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you if there&#39;s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry&#39;s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn&#39;t have liked it - there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting - but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,&quot; Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve seen those things they think are gnomes,&quot; said Ron, bent double with his head in a peony bush, &quot;like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods...&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened up. &quot; This is a gnome,&quot; he said grimly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Gerroff me! Gerroff me!&quot; squealed the gnome.<br /> <br /> It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm&#39;s length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is what you have to do,&quot; he said. He raised the gnome above his head (&quot;Gerroff me!&quot;) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry&#39;s face, Ron added, &quot;It doesn&#39;t hurt them -you&#39;ve just got to make them really dizzy so they can&#39;t find their way back to the gnome holes.&quot;<br /> <br /> He let go of the gnome&#39;s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Pitiful,&quot; said Fred. &quot;I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry&#39;s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off - until--<br /> <br /> &quot;Wow, Harry - that must&#39;ve been fifty feet...&quot;<br /> <br /> The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.<br /> <br /> &quot;See, they&#39;re not too bright,&quot; said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. &quot;The moment they know the de-gnoming&#39;s going on they storm up to have a look. You&#39;d think they&#39;d have learned by now just to stay put.&quot;<br /> <br /> Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their little shoulders hunched.<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;ll be back,&quot; said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on the other side of the field. &quot;They love it here... Dad&#39;s too soft with them; he thinks they&#39;re funny...&quot;<br /> <br /> Just then, the front door slammed.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s back!&quot; said George. &quot;Dad&#39;s home!&quot;<br /> <br /> They hurried through the garden and back into the house.<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children&#39;s. He was wearing long green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn.<br /> <br /> &quot;What a night,&quot; he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat down around him. &quot;Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned...&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Find anything, Dad?&quot; said Fred eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,&quot; yawned Mr. Weasley. &quot;There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn&#39;t my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that&#39;s the Committee on Experimental Charms, thank goodness...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?&quot; said George.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just Muggle-baiting,&quot; sighed Mr. Weasley. &quot;Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they need it... Of course, it&#39;s very hard to convict anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking - they&#39;ll insist they just keep losing it. Bless them, they&#39;ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it&#39;s staring them in the face... But the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn&#39;t believe--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley&#39;s eyes jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.<br /> <br /> &quot;C-cars, Molly, dear?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, Arthur, cars,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. &quot;Imagine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted to do with it was take it apart to see how it worked, while really he was enchanting it to make it fly .&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley blinked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, dear, I think you&#39;ll find that he would be quite within the law to do that, even if - er - he maybe would have done better to, um, tell his wife the truth... There&#39;s a loophole in the law, you&#39;ll find... As long as he wasn&#39;t intending to fly the car, the fact that the car could fly wouldn&#39;t--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you wrote that law!&quot; shouted Mrs. Weasley. &quot;Just so you could carry on tinkering with all that Muggle rubbish in your shed! And for your information, Harry arrived this morning in the car you weren&#39;t intending to fly!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry?&quot; said Mr. Weasley blankly. &quot;Harry who?&quot;<br /> <br /> He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron&#39;s told us so much about--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Your sons flew that car to Harry&#39;s house and back last night!&quot; shouted Mrs. Weasley. &quot;What have you got to say about that, eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you really?&quot; said Mr. Weasley eagerly. &quot;Did it go all right? I - I mean,&quot; he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley&#39;s eyes, &quot;that - that was very wrong, boys - very wrong indeed...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s leave them to it,&quot; Ron muttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley swelled like a bullfrog. &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll show you my bedroom.&quot;<br /> <br /> They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just caught sight of a pair of bright brown eyes staring at him before it closed with a snap.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ginny,&quot; said Ron. &quot;You don&#39;t know how weird it is for her to be this shy. She never shuts up normally--&quot;<br /> <br /> They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying RONALD&#39;S ROOM .<br /> <br /> Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron&#39;s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically.<br /> <br /> &quot;Your Quidditch team?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Chudley Cannons,&quot; said Ron, pointing at the orange bedspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C&#39;s and a speeding cannonball. &quot;Ninth in the league.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s school spellbooks were stacked untidily in a corner, next to a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron&#39;s magic wand was lying on top of a fish tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun.<br /> <br /> Harry stepped over a pack of Self-Shuffling playing cards on the floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys&#39;hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watching him almost nervously, as though waiting for his opinion.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a bit small,&quot; said Ron quickly. &quot;Not like that room you had with the Muggles. And I&#39;m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; he&#39;s always banging on the pipes and groaning...&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry, grinning widely, said, &quot;This is the best house I&#39;ve ever been in.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s ears went pink.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> "

          "content": "<p> Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys&#39;house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, &quot;Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!&quot; The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George&#39;s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron&#39;s, however, wasn&#39;t the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fascinating .&quot; he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. &quot; Ingenious , really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn&#39;t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Letters from school,&quot; said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. &quot;Dumbledore already knows you&#39;re here, Harry - doesn&#39;t miss a trick, that man. You two&#39;ve got them, too,&quot; he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.<br /> <br /> For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry&#39;s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King&#39;s Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he&#39;d need for the coming year.<br /> <br /> SECOND-YEAR STUDENTS WILL REQUIRE:<br /> <br /> The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 by Miranda Goshawk<br /> <br /> Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> 43 Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart<br /> <br /> Fred, who had finished his own list, peered over at Harry&#39;s.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve been told to get all Lockhart&#39;s books, too!&quot; he said. &quot;The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it&#39;s a witch.&quot;<br /> <br /> At this point, Fred caught his mother&#39;s eye and quickly busied himself with the marmalade.<br /> <br /> &quot;That lot won&#39;t come cheap,&quot; said George, with a quick look at his parents. &quot;Lockhart&#39;s books are really expensive...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, we&#39;ll manage,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked worried. &quot;I expect we&#39;ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny&#39;s things secondhand.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?&quot; Harry asked Ginny.<br /> <br /> She nodded, blushing to the roots of her flaming hair, and put her elbow in the butter dish. Fortunately no one saw this except Harry, because just then Ron&#39;s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his sweater vest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Morning, all,&quot; said Percy briskly. &quot;Lovely day.&quot;<br /> <br /> He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again almost immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray feather duster - at least, that was what Harry thought it was, until he saw that it was breathing.<br /> <br /> &quot;Errol!&quot; said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting a letter from under its wing. &quot; Finally - he&#39;s got Hermione&#39;s answer. I wrote to her saying we were going to try and rescue you from the Dursleys.&quot;<br /> <br /> He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to stand him on it, but Errol flopped straight off again so Ron lay him on the draining board instead, muttering, &quot;Pathetic.&quot; Then he ripped open Hermione&#39;s letter and read it out loud:<br /> <br /> &quot;`Dear Ron, and Harry if you&#39;re there,<br /> <br /> &quot;`I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you didn&#39;t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would get Harry into trouble, too. I&#39;ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m very busy with schoolwork, of course&#39;- How can she be?&quot; said Ron in horror. &quot;We&#39;re on vacation! - and we&#39;re going to London next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don&#39;t we meet in Diagon Alley?<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me know what&#39;s happening as soon as you can. Love from Hermione.&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, that fits in nicely, we can go and get all your things then, too,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. &quot;What&#39;re you all up to today?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn&#39;t fly too high.<br /> <br /> They couldn&#39;t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry&#39;s Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron&#39;s old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.<br /> <br /> Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wish I knew what he was up to,&quot; said Fred, frowning. &quot;He&#39;s not himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ordinary Wizarding Levels,&quot; George explained, seeing Harry&#39;s puzzled look. &quot;Bill got twelve, too. If we&#39;re not careful, we&#39;ll have another Head Boy in the family. I don&#39;t think I could stand the shame.&quot;<br /> <br /> Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt working for the wizard&#39;s bank, Gringotts.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year,&quot; said George after a while. &quot;Five sets of Lockhart books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn&#39;t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn&#39;t think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re running low, Arthur,&quot; she sighed. &quot;We&#39;ll have to buy some more today... Ah well, guests first! After you, Harry dear!&quot;<br /> <br /> And she offered him the flowerpot.<br /> <br /> Harry stared at them all watching him.<br /> <br /> &quot;W-what am I supposed to do?&quot; he stammered.<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s never traveled by Floo powder,&quot; said Ron suddenly. &quot;Sorry, Harry, I forgot.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Never?&quot; said Mr. Weasley. &quot;But how did you get to Diagon Alley to buy your school things last year?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I went on the Underground--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Really?&quot; said Mr. Weasley eagerly. &quot;Were there escapators ? How exactly--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not now , Arthur,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley. &quot;Floo powder&#39;s a lot quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you&#39;ve never used it before--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;ll be all right, Mum,&quot; said Fred. &quot;Harry, watch us first.&quot;<br /> <br /> He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames.<br /> <br /> With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, &quot;Diagon Alley!&quot; and vanished.<br /> <br /> &quot;You must speak clearly, dear,&quot; Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. &quot;And be sure to get out at the right grate...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The right what?&quot; said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of sight, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, but as long as you&#39;ve spoken clearly--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;ll be fine, Molly, don&#39;t fuss,&quot; said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to Floo powder too.<br /> <br /> &quot;But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and uncle?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They wouldn&#39;t mind,&quot; Harry reassured her. &quot;Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don&#39;t worry about that--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well... all right... you go after Arthur,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley. &quot;Now, when you get into the fire, say where you&#39;re going.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And keep your elbows tucked in,&quot; Ron advised.<br /> <br /> &quot;And your eyes shut,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley. &quot;The soot--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t fidget,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Or you might well fall out of the wrong fireplace--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But don&#39;t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and George.&quot;<br /> <br /> Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot of hot ash.<br /> <br /> &quot;D-Dia-gon Alley,&quot; he coughed.<br /> <br /> It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed to be spinning very fast - the roaring in his ears was deafening - he tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him feel sick -something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again wishing it would stop, and then...<br /> <br /> He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses snap.<br /> <br /> Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard&#39;s shop - but nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list.<br /> <br /> A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was definitely not Diagon Alley.<br /> <br /> The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently toward the door, but before he&#39;d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass - and one of them was the very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy.<br /> <br /> Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet to his left; he shot inside it and pulled the doors closed, leaving a small crack to peer through. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Malfoy stepped into the shop.<br /> <br /> The man who followed could only be Draco&#39;s father. He had the same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, &quot;Touch nothing, Draco.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy, who had reached for the glass eye, said, &quot;I thought you were going to buy me a present.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I said I would buy you a racing broom,&quot; said his father, drumming his fingers on the counter.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the good of that if I&#39;m not on the House team?&quot; said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. &quot;Harry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He&#39;s not even that good, it&#39;s just because he&#39;s famous... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead...&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.<br /> <br /> &quot;...everyone thinks he&#39;s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You have told me this at least a dozen times already,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. &quot;And I would remind you that it is not - prudent - to appear less than fond of Harry Potter, not when most of our kind regard him as the hero who made the Dark Lord disappear - ah, Mr. Borgin.&quot;<br /> <br /> A stooping man had appeared behind the counter, smoothing his greasy hair back from his face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,&quot; said Mr. Borgin in a voice as oily as his hair. &quot;Delighted - and young Master Malfoy, too - charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, just in today, and very reasonably priced--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Selling?&quot; The smile faded slightly from Mr. Borgin&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;You have heard, of course, that the Ministry is conducting more raids,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy, taking a roll of parchment from his inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. &quot;I have a few - ah - items at home that might embarrass me, if the Ministry were to call...&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pince-nez to his nose and looked down the list.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Ministry wouldn&#39;t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Malfoy&#39;s lip curled.<br /> <br /> &quot;I have not been visited yet. The name Malfoy still commands a certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. There are rumors about a new Muggle Protection Act - no doubt that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind it--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt a hot surge of anger.<br /> <br /> &quot;- and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it appear--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I understand, sir, of course,&quot; said Mr. Borgin. &quot;Let me see...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Can I have that?&quot; interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered hand on its cushion.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, the Hand of Glory!&quot; said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. Malfoy&#39;s list and scurrying over to Draco. &quot;Insert a candle and it gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! Your son has fine taste, sir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, &quot;No offense, sir, no offense meant--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Though if his grades don&#39;t pick up,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, &quot;that may indeed be all he is fit for--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; retorted Draco. &quot;The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I would have thought you&#39;d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,&quot; snapped Mr. Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ha!&quot; said Harry under his breath, pleased to see Draco looking both abashed and angry.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s the same all over,&quot; said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. &quot;Wizard blood is counting for less everywhere--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not with me,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy, his long nostrils flaring.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, sir, nor with me, sir,&quot; said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow.<br /> <br /> &quot;In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy shortly. &quot;I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today--&quot;<br /> <br /> They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman&#39;s rope and to read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed - Has Claimed the Lives of Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date.<br /> <br /> Draco turned away and saw the cabinet right in front of him. He walked forward - he stretched out his hand for the handle &quot;Done,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. &quot;Come, Draco--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I&#39;ll expect you at the manor tomorrow to pick up the goods.&quot;<br /> <br /> The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily manner.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if the stories are true, you haven&#39;t sold me half of what&#39;s hidden in your manor...&quot;<br /> <br /> Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin disappeared into a back room. Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he could, slipped out of the cabinet, past the glass cases, and out of the shop door.<br /> <br /> Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. He had emerged into a dingy alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. The one he&#39;d just left, Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty window display of shrunken heads and, two doors down, a large cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wizards were watching him from the shadow of a doorway, muttering to each other. Feeling jumpy, Harry set off, trying to hold his glasses on straight and hoping against hope he&#39;d be able to find a way out of here.<br /> <br /> An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poisonous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn&#39;t help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn&#39;t spoken clearly enough through his mouthful of ashes back in the Weasleys&#39;fire. Trying to stay calm, he wondered what to do.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not lost are you, my dear?&quot; said a voice in his ear, making him jump.<br /> <br /> An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m just--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;HARRY! What d&#39;yeh think yer doin&#39;down there?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s heart leapt. So did the witch; a load of fingernails cascaded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of Hagrid, the Hogwarts&#39;gamekeeper, came striding toward them, beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot; Harry croaked in relief. &quot;I was lost - Floo powder--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid seized Harry by the scruff of the neck and pulled him away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble building in the distance - Gringotts Bank. Hagrid had steered him right into Diagon Alley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yer a mess!&quot; said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so forcefully he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary. &quot;Skulkin&#39;around Knockturn Alley, I dunno dodgy place, Harry - don&#39;want no one ter see yeh down there--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I realized that ,&quot; said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush him off again. &quot;I told you, I was lost - what were you doing down there, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I was lookin&#39;fer a Flesh-Eatin&#39;Slug Repellent,&quot; growled Hagrid. &quot;They&#39;re ruinin&#39;the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,&quot; Harry explained. &quot;I&#39;ve got to go and find them...&quot;<br /> <br /> They set off together down the street.<br /> <br /> &quot;How come yeh never wrote back ter me?&quot; said Hagrid as Harry jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of Hagrid&#39;s enormous boots). Harry explained all about Dobby and the Dursleys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lousy Muggles,&quot; growled Hagrid. &quot;If I&#39;d&#39;ve known--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry! Harry! Over here!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet them, her bushy brown hair flying behind her.<br /> <br /> &quot;What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid - Oh, it&#39;s wonderful to see you two again - Are you coming into Gringotts, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;As soon as I&#39;ve found the Weasleys,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh won&#39;t have long ter wait,&quot; Hagrid said with a grin.<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione looked around: Sprinting up the crowded street were Ron, Fred, George, Percy, and Mr. Weasley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry,&quot; Mr. Weasley panted. &quot;We hoped you&#39;d only gone one grate too far...&quot; He mopped his glistening bald patch. &quot;Molly&#39;s frantic - she&#39;s coming now--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Where did you come out?&quot; Ron asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Knockturn Alley,&quot; said Hagrid grimly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excellent!&quot; said Fred and George together.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve never been allowed in,&quot; said Ron enviously.<br /> <br /> &quot;I should ruddy well think not,&quot; growled Hagrid. Mrs. Weasley now came galloping into view, her handbag swinging wildly in one hand, Ginny just clinging onto the other.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Harry - oh, my dear - you could have been anywhere--&quot;<br /> <br /> Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her bag and began sweeping off the soot Hagrid hadn&#39;t managed to beat away. Mr. Weasley took Harry&#39;s glasses, gave them a tap of his wand, and returned them, good as new.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, gotta be off,&quot; said Hagrid, who was having his hand wrung by Mrs. Weasley (&quot;Knockturn Alley! If you hadn&#39;t found him, Hagrid!&quot;). &quot;See yer at Hogwarts!&quot; And he strode away, head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street.<br /> <br /> &quot;Guess who I saw in Borgin and Burkes?&quot; Harry asked Ron and Hermione as they climbed the Gringotts steps. &quot;Malfoy and his father.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?&quot; said Mr. Weasley sharply behind them.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, he was selling--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So he&#39;s worried,&quot; said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. &quot;Oh, I&#39;d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something ...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You be careful, Arthur,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. &quot;That family&#39;s trouble. Don&#39;t go biting off more than you can chew--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So you don&#39;t think I&#39;m a match for Lucius Malfoy?&quot; said Mr. Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the sight of Hermione&#39;s parents, who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for Hermione to introduce them.<br /> <br /> &quot;But you&#39;re Muggles!&quot; said Mr. Weasley delightedly. &quot;We must have a drink! What&#39;s that you&#39;ve got there? Oh, you&#39;re changing Muggle money. Molly, look!&quot; He pointed excitedly at the ten-pound notes in Mr. Granger&#39;s hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Meet you back here,&quot; Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another Gringotts goblin.<br /> <br /> The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts that sped along miniature train tracks through the bank&#39;s underground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys&#39;vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knockturn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag. Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to block the contents from view as he hastily shoved handfuls of coins into a leather bag.<br /> <br /> Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy muttered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was insisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a drink.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your schoolbooks,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. &quot;And not one step down Knockturn Alley!&quot; she shouted at the twins&#39;retreating backs.<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cobbled street. The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry&#39;s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster&#39;s Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power .<br /> <br /> &quot;A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers,&quot; Ron read aloud off the back cover. &quot;That sounds fascinating ...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go away,&quot; Percy snapped.<br /> <br /> &quot;Course, he&#39;s very ambitious, Percy, he&#39;s got it all planned out... He wants to be Minister of Magic...&quot; Ron told Harry and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it.<br /> <br /> An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by no means the only ones making their way to the bookshop. As they approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling outside the doors, trying to get in. The reason for this was proclaimed by a large banner stretched across the upper windows:<br /> <br /> GILDEROY LOCKHART<br /> <br /> will be signing copies of his autobiography<br /> <br /> MAGICAL ME<br /> <br /> today 12:30 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.<br /> <br /> &quot;We can actually meet him!&quot; Hermione squealed. &quot;I mean, he&#39;s written almost the whole booklist!&quot;<br /> <br /> The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around Mrs. Weasley&#39;s age. A harassed-looking wizard stood at the door, saying, &quot;Calmly, please, ladies... Don&#39;t push, there... mind the books, now...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to where the rest of the Weasleys were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, there you are, good,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded breathless and kept patting her hair. &quot;We&#39;ll be able to see him in a minute...&quot;<br /> <br /> Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his eyes; his pointed wizard&#39;s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy hair.<br /> <br /> A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking photographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple smoke with every blinding flash.<br /> <br /> &quot;Out of the way, there,&quot; he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a better shot. &quot;This is for the Daily Prophet--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Big deal,&quot; said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer had stepped on it.<br /> <br /> Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron - and then he saw Harry. He stared. Then he leapt to his feet and positively shouted, &quot;It can&#39;t be Harry Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> The crowd parted, whispering excitedly; Lockhart dived forward, seized Harry&#39;s arm, and pulled him to the front. The crowd burst into applause. Harry&#39;s face burned as Lockhart shook his hand for the photographer, who was clicking away madly, wafting thick smoke over the Weasleys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nice big smile, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart, through his own gleaming teeth. &quot;Together, you and I are worth the front page.&quot;<br /> <br /> When he finally let go of Harry&#39;s hand, Harry could hardly feel his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lockhart threw an arm around his shoulders and clamped him tightly to his side.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; he said loudly, waving for quiet. &quot;What an extraordinary moment this is! The perfect moment for me to make a little announcement I&#39;ve been sitting on for some time!<br /> <br /> &quot;When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts today, he only wanted to buy my autobiography - which I shall be happy to present him now, free of charge -&quot; The crowd applauded again. &quot;He had no idea ,&quot; Lockhart continued, giving Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, &quot;that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, Magical Me . He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real magical me. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September, I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!&quot;<br /> <br /> The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing next to her new cauldron.<br /> <br /> &quot;You have these,&quot; Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. &quot;I&#39;ll buy my own--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet you loved that, didn&#39;t you, Potter?&quot; said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing. He straightened up and found himself face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Famous Harry Potter,&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;Can&#39;t even go into a bookshop without making the front page.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Leave him alone, he didn&#39;t want all that!&quot; said Ginny. It was the first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, you&#39;ve got yourself a girlfriend!&quot; drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart&#39;s books.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you,&quot; said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. &quot;Bet you&#39;re surprised to see Harry here, eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,&quot; retorted Malfoy. &quot;I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione grabbed the back of his jacket.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron!&quot; said Mr. Weasley, struggling over with Fred and George. &quot;What are you doing? It&#39;s too crowded in here, let&#39;s go outside.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, well, well - Arthur Weasley.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco&#39;s shoulder, sneering in just the same way.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lucius,&quot; said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy. &quot;All those raids... I hope they&#39;re paying you overtime?&quot;<br /> <br /> He reached into Ginny&#39;s cauldron and extracted, from amid the glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Transfiguration .<br /> <br /> &quot;Obviously not,&quot; Mr. Malfoy said. &quot;Dear me, what&#39;s the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don&#39;t even pay you well for it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley flushed darker than either Ron or Ginny.<br /> <br /> &quot;We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Clearly,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. &quot;The company you keep, Weasley... and I thought your family could sink no lower.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a thud of metal as Ginny&#39;s cauldron went flying; Mr. Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him backward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thundering down on all their heads; there was a yell of, &quot;Get him, Dad!&quot; from Fred or George; Mrs. Weasley was shrieking, &quot;No, Arthur, no!&quot;; the crowd stampeded backward, knocking more shelves over; &quot;Gentlemen, please - please!&quot; cried the assistant, and then, louder than all--<br /> <br /> &quot;Break it up, there, gents, break it up--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools . He was still holding Ginny&#39;s old Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with malice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Here, girl - take your book - it&#39;s the best your father can give you -&quot; Pulling himself out of Hagrid&#39;s grip he beckoned to Draco and swept from the shop.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh should&#39;ve ignored him, Arthur,&quot; said Hagrid, almost lifting Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straightened his robes. &quot;Rotten ter the core, the whole family, everyone knows that - no Malfoy&#39;s worth listenin&#39;ter - bad blood, that&#39;s what it is - come on now - let&#39;s get outta here.&quot;<br /> <br /> The assistant looked as though he wanted to stop them leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid&#39;s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking with fright and Mrs. Weasley beside herself with fury.<br /> <br /> &quot;A fine example to set for your children... brawling in public... what Gilderoy Lockhart must&#39;ve thought--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He was pleased,&quot; said Fred. &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear him as we were leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he&#39;d be able to work the fight into his report - said it was all publicity--&quot;<br /> <br /> But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shopping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. They said good-bye to the Grangers, who were leaving the pub for the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask them how bus stops worked, but stopped quickly at the look on Mrs. Weasley&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket before helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn&#39;t his favorite way to travel.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p> "

          "content": "<p> The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry&#39;s liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet Drive.<br /> <br /> On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of Harry&#39;s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.<br /> <br /> It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow they still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny&#39;s trunk to the car.<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features that Mr. Weasley had added.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not a word to Molly,&quot; he whispered to Harry as he opened the. trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.<br /> <br /> When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said, &quot;Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don&#39;t they?&quot; She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. &quot;I mean, you&#39;d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he&#39;d see it again when they were back. George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she&#39;d left her diary. By the time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers were running high.<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.<br /> <br /> &quot;Molly, dear--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No , Arthur --&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No one would see - this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed - that&#39;d get us up in the air - then we fly above the clouds. We&#39;d be there in ten minutes and no one would be any the wiser--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight--&quot;<br /> <br /> They reached King&#39;s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.<br /> <br /> Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn&#39;t visible to the Muggle eye. What you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It didn&#39;t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing.<br /> <br /> &quot;Percy first,&quot; said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier.<br /> <br /> Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George followed.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,&quot; Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny&#39;s hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go together, we&#39;ve only got a minute,&quot; Ron said to Harry.<br /> <br /> Harry made sure that Hedwig&#39;s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn&#39;t nearly as uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away from it, they broke into a run and--<br /> <br /> CRASH.<br /> <br /> Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron&#39;s trunk fell off with a loud thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig&#39;s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard nearby yelled, &quot;What in blazes d&#39;you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Lost control of the trolley,&quot; Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why can&#39;t we get through?&quot; Harry hissed to Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;I dunno--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re going to miss the train,&quot; Ron whispered. &quot;I don&#39;t understand why the gateway&#39;s sealed itself--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten seconds... nine seconds...<br /> <br /> He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.<br /> <br /> Three seconds... two seconds... one second...<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s gone,&quot; said Ron, sounding stunned. &quot;The train&#39;s left. What if Mum and Dad can&#39;t get back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry gave a hollow laughed. &quot;The Dursleys haven&#39;t given me pocket money for about six years.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t hear a thing,&quot; he said tensely, &quot;What&#39;re we going to do? I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.&quot;<br /> <br /> They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig&#39;s continuing screeches.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think we&#39;d better go and wait by the car,&quot; said Harry. &quot;We&#39;re attracting too much atten--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry!&quot; said Ron, his eyes gleaming. &quot;The car!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What about it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We can fly the car to Hogwarts!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I thought--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re stuck, right? And we&#39;ve got to get to school, haven&#39;t we? And even underage wizards are allowed to use magic if it&#39;s a real emergency, section nineteen or something of the Restriction of Thingy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But your Mum and Dad...&quot; said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain hope that it would give way. &quot;How will they get home?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They don&#39;t need the car!&quot; said Ron impatiently. &quot;They know how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder and the car because we&#39;re all underage and we&#39;re not allowed to Apparate yet...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s feeling of panic turned suddenly to excitement.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you fly it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, problem,&quot; said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the exit. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go. If we hurry we&#39;ll be able to follow the Hogwarts Express--&quot;<br /> <br /> And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.<br /> <br /> Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front.<br /> <br /> &quot;Check that no one&#39;s watching,&quot; said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was empty.<br /> <br /> &quot;Okay,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished - and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; said Ron&#39;s voice from his right.<br /> <br /> And the ground and the dirty buildings on either side fell away, dropping out of sight as the car rose; in seconds, the whole of London lay, smoky and glittering, below them.<br /> <br /> Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron reappeared.<br /> <br /> &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. &quot;It&#39;s faulty--&quot;<br /> <br /> Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hold on!&quot; Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything turned dull and foggy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what?&quot; said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing in on them from all sides.<br /> <br /> &quot;We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dip back down again - quickly--&quot;<br /> <br /> They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their seats, squinting at the ground.<br /> <br /> &quot;I can see it!&quot; Harry yelled. &quot;Right ahead - there!&quot;<br /> <br /> The Hogwarts Express was streaking along below them like a scarlet snake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Due north,&quot; said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on--&quot;<br /> <br /> And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of sunlight.<br /> <br /> It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.<br /> <br /> &quot;All we&#39;ve got to worry about now are airplanes,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn&#39;t stop.<br /> <br /> It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing Fred&#39;s and George&#39;s jealous faces when they landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of Hogwarts castle.<br /> <br /> They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches.<br /> <br /> Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Harry&#39;s T-shirt was sticking to the back of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why hadn&#39;t they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters?<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t be much further, can it?&quot; croaked Ron, hours later still, as the sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. &quot;Ready for another check on the train?&quot;<br /> <br /> It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds.<br /> <br /> Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, but as he did so, the engine began to whine.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s probably just tired,&quot; said Ron. &quot;It&#39;s never been this far before...&quot;<br /> <br /> And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, trying to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving feebly, as though in protest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not far,&quot; said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, &quot;not far now,&quot; and he patted the dashboard nervously.<br /> <br /> When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew.<br /> <br /> &quot;There!&quot; Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. &quot;Straight ahead!&quot;<br /> <br /> Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle.<br /> <br /> But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a little shake, &quot;nearly there, come on--&quot;<br /> <br /> The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from under the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat very hard as they flew toward the lake.<br /> <br /> The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. Ron&#39;s knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; Ron muttered.<br /> <br /> They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron put his foot down.<br /> <br /> There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died completely.<br /> <br /> &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; said Ron, into the silence.<br /> <br /> The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, heading straight for the solid castle wall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Noooooo!&quot; Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time.<br /> <br /> Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of his back pocket--<br /> <br /> &quot;STOP! STOP!&quot; he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the windshield, but they were still plummeting, the ground flying up toward them--<br /> <br /> &quot;WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!&quot; Harry bellowed, lunging for the steering wheel, but too late--<br /> <br /> CRUNCH.<br /> <br /> With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick tree trunk and dropped to the ground with a heavy jolt. Steam was billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry&#39;s head where he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, despairing groan.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Harry said urgently.<br /> <br /> &quot;My wand,&quot; said Ron, in a shaky voice. &quot;Look at my wand--&quot;<br /> <br /> It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a few splinters.<br /> <br /> Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they&#39;d be able to mend it up at the school, but he never even got started. At that very moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an equally heavy blow hit the roof.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s happen -?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could reach.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aaargh!&quot; said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into his door; the windshield was now trembling under a hail of blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving in.<br /> <br /> &quot;Run for it!&quot; Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry&#39;s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re done for!&quot; he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Reverse!&quot; Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach.<br /> <br /> &quot;That,&quot; panted Ron, &quot;was close. Well done, car--&quot;<br /> <br /> The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig&#39;s cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come back!&quot; Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. &quot;Dad&#39;ll kill me!&quot;<br /> <br /> But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you believe our luck?&quot; said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. &quot;Of all the trees we could&#39;ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.&quot;<br /> <br /> He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches threateningly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; said Harry wearily, &quot;we&#39;d better get up to the school...&quot;<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think the feast&#39;s already started,&quot; said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a brightly lit window. &quot;Hey - Harry - come and look - it&#39;s the Sorting!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the Great Hall.<br /> <br /> Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky outside, sparkled with stars.<br /> <br /> Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny was among them, easily visible because of her vivid Weasley hair. Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat on a stool before the newcomers.<br /> <br /> Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven years.<br /> <br /> A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head. Harry&#39;s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hang on...&quot; Harry muttered to Ron. &quot;There&#39;s an empty chair at the staff table... Where&#39;s Snape?&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor Severus Snape was Harry&#39;s least favorite teacher. Harry also happened to be Snape&#39;s least favorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, and disliked by everybody except the students from his own house (Slytherin), Snape taught Potions.<br /> <br /> &quot;Maybe he&#39;s ill!&quot; said Ron hopefully.<br /> <br /> &quot;Maybe he&#39;s left ,&quot; said Harry, &quot;because he missed out on the Defense Against Dark Arts job again!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Or he might have been sacked!&quot; said Ron enthusiastically. &quot;I mean, everyone hates him--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Or maybe,&quot; said a very cold voice right behind them, &quot;he&#39;s waiting to hear why you two didn&#39;t arrive on the school train.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder-length black hair, and at this moment, he was smiling in a way that told Harry he and Ron were in very deep trouble.<br /> <br /> &quot;Follow me,&quot; said Snape.<br /> <br /> Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.<br /> <br /> &quot;In!&quot; he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing.<br /> <br /> They entered Snape&#39;s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were lined with shelves of large glass jars, in which floated all manner of revolting things Harry didn&#39;t really want to know the name of at the moment. The fireplace was dark and empty. Snape closed the door and turned to look at them.<br /> <br /> &quot;So,&quot; he said softly, &quot;the train isn&#39;t good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we, boys?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, sir, it was the barrier at King&#39;s Cross, it--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Silence!&quot; said Snape coldly. &quot;What have you done with the car?&quot; Ron gulped. This wasn&#39;t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today&#39;s issue of the Evening Prophet . &quot;You were seen,&quot; he hissed, showing them the headline : FLYING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read aloud: &quot;Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower... at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing... Mr. Angus Fleet, of Peebles, reported to police... Six or seven Muggles in all. I believe your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?&quot; he said, looking up at Ron and smiling still more nastily. &quot;Dear, dear... his own son...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry felt as though he&#39;d just been walloped in the stomach by one of the mad tree&#39;s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car... he hadn&#39;t thought of that...<br /> <br /> &quot;I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,&quot; Snape went on.<br /> <br /> &quot;That tree did more damage to us than we -&quot; Ron blurted out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Silence!&quot; snapped Snape again. &quot;Most unfortunately, you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. You will wait here.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn&#39;t feel hungry any more. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a shelf behind Snape&#39;s desk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely strict.<br /> <br /> Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who accompanied him. Harry had seen Professor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the empty fireplace, where flames suddenly erupted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sit,&quot; she said, and they both backed into chairs by the fire.<br /> <br /> &quot;Explain,&quot; she said, her glasses glinting ominously.<br /> <br /> Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the station refusing to let them through.<br /> <br /> &quot;- so we had no choice, Professor, we couldn&#39;t get on the train.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why didn&#39;t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an owl?&quot; Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry.<br /> <br /> Harry gaped at her. Now she said it, that seemed the obvious thing to have done.<br /> <br /> &quot;I - I didn&#39;t think--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That,&quot; said Professor McGonagall, &quot;is obvious.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking happier than ever, opened it. There stood the headmaster, Professor Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s whole body went numb. Dumbledore was looking unusually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and Harry suddenly found himself wishing he and Ron were still being beaten up by the Whomping Willow.<br /> <br /> There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, &quot;Please explain why you did this.&quot;<br /> <br /> It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the disappointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told Dumbledore everything except that Mr. Weasley owned the bewitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumbledore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no questions about the car. When Harry had finished, he merely continued to peer at them through his spectacles.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll go and get our stuff,&quot; said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you talking about, Weasley?&quot; barked Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, you&#39;re expelling us, aren&#39;t you?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not today, Mr. Weasley,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again, I will have no choice but to expel you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape looked as though Christmas had been canceled. He cleared his throat and said, &quot;Professor Dumbledore, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry, caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys&#39;punishments, Severus,&quot; said Dumbledore calmly. &quot;They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility.&quot; He turned to Professor McGonagall. &quot;I must go back to the feast, Minerva, I&#39;ve got to give out a few notices. Come, Severus, there&#39;s a delicious-looking custard tart I want to sample--&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed himself to be swept out of his office, leaving them alone with Professor McGonagall, who was still eyeing them like a wrathful eagle.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you&#39;re bleeding.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not much,&quot; said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with his sleeve.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The Sorting Ceremony is over,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;Your sister is also in Gryffindor.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, good,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;And speaking of Gryffindor -&quot; Professor McGonagall said sharply, but Harry cut in: &quot;Professor, when we took the car, term hadn&#39;t started, so - so Gryffindor shouldn&#39;t really have points taken from it - should it?&quot; he finished, watching her anxiously.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure she had almost smiled. Her mouth looked less thin, anyway.<br /> <br /> &quot;I will not take any points from Gryffindor,&quot; she said, and Harry&#39;s heart lightened considerably. &quot;But you will both get a detention.&quot; It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore&#39;s writing to the Dursleys, that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly well they&#39;d just be disappointed that the Whomping Willow hadn&#39;t squashed him flat.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at Snape&#39;s desk. A large plate of sandwiches, two silver goblets, and a jug of iced pumpkin juice appeared with a pop.<br /> <br /> &quot;You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,&quot; she said. &quot;I must also return to the feast.&quot;<br /> <br /> When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low whistle.<br /> <br /> &quot;I thought we&#39;d had it,&quot; he said, grabbing a sandwich.<br /> <br /> &quot;So did I,&quot; said Harry, taking one, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you believe our luck, though?&quot; said Ron thickly through a mouthful of chicken and ham. &quot;Fred and George must&#39;ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them .&quot; He swallowed and took another huge bite. &quot; Why couldn&#39;t we get through the barrier?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shrugged. &quot;We&#39;ll have to watch our step from now on, though,&quot; he said, taking a grateful swig of pumpkin juice. &quot;Wish we could&#39;ve gone up to the feast...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;She didn&#39;t want us showing off,&quot; said Ron sagely. &quot;Doesn&#39;t want people to think it&#39;s clever, arriving by flying car.&quot;<br /> <br /> When they had eaten as many sandwiches as they could (the plate kept refilling itself) they rose and left the office, treading the familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and climbed narrow flights of stone stairs, until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.<br /> <br /> &quot;Password?&quot; she said as they approached.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> They didn&#39;t know the new year&#39;s password, not having met a Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione dashing toward them.<br /> <br /> &quot;There you are! Where have you been ? The most ridiculous rumors - someone said you&#39;d been expelled for crashing a flying car!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, we haven&#39;t been expelled,&quot; Harry assured her.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re not telling me you did fly here?&quot; said Hermione, sounding almost as severe as Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Skip the lecture,&quot; said Ron impatiently, &quot;and tell us the new password.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s wattlebird,&#39;&quot; said Hermione impatiently, &quot;but that&#39;s not the point--&quot;<br /> <br /> Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed into the circular common room, standing on the lopsided tables and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached through the portrait hole to pull Harry and Ron inside, leaving Hermione to scramble in after them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Brilliant!&quot; yelled Lee Jordan. &quot;Inspired! What an entrance! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow, people&#39;ll be talking about that one for years--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good for you,&quot; said a fifth year Harry had never spoken to; someone was patting him on the back as though he&#39;d just won a marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, &quot;Why couldn&#39;t we&#39;ve come in the car, eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry could see one person who didn&#39;t look happy at all. Percy was visible over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be trying to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron in the ribs and nodded in Percy&#39;s direction. Ron got the point at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Got to get upstairs - bit tired,&quot; he said, and the two of them started pushing their way toward the door on the other side of the room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories.<br /> <br /> &quot;Night,&quot; Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a scowl just like Percy&#39;s.<br /> <br /> They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds.<br /> <br /> Ron grinned guiltily at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know I shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve enjoyed that or anything, but...&quot;<br /> <br /> The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and Neville Longbottom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Unbelievable!&quot; beamed Seamus.<br /> <br /> &quot;Cool,&quot; said Dean.<br /> <br /> &quot;Amazing,&quot; said Neville, awestruck.<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t help it. He grinned, too.</p>"

          "content": "<p> The next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling (today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the way she said &quot;Morning,&quot; which told Harry that she was still disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mail&#39;s due any minute - I think Gran&#39;s sending a few things I forgot.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had only just started his porridge when, sure enough, there was a rushing sound overhead and a hundred or so owls streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville&#39;s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione&#39;s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers.<br /> <br /> &quot;Errol!&quot; said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol slumped, Unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a damp red envelope in his beak.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no -&quot; Ron gasped.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s all right, he&#39;s still alive,&quot; said Hermione, prodding Errol gently with the tip of her finger.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not that - it&#39;s that .&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both looking at it as though they expected it to explode.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;She&#39;s - she&#39;s sent me a Howler,&quot; said Ron faintly.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better open it, Ron,&quot; said Neville in a timid whisper. &quot;It&#39;ll be worse if you Don&#39;t My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it and&quot; - he gulped -&quot;it was horrible.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked from their petrified faces to the red envelope.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s a Howler?&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> But Ron&#39;s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had begun to smoke at the corners.<br /> <br /> &quot;Open it,&quot; Neville urged. &quot;It&#39;ll all be over in a few minutes--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron stretched out a shaking hand, eased the envelope from Errol&#39;s beak, and slit it open. Neville stuffed his fingers in his ears. A split second later, Harry knew why. He thought for a moment it had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust from the ceiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;-STEALING THE CAR, I WOULDN&#39;T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED IF THEY&#39;D EXPELLED YOU, YOU WAIT TILL I GET HOLD OF YOU, I DON&#39;T SUPPOSE YOU STOPPED TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATHER AND I WENT THROUGH WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE--&quot;<br /> <br /> Mrs. Weasleys yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly off the stone walls. People throughout the hall were swiveling around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low in his chair that only his crimson forehead could be seen.<br /> <br /> &quot;-LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE DIDN&#39;T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had been wondering when his name was going to crop up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn&#39;t hear the voice that was making his eardrums throb.<br /> <br /> &quot;-ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED - YOUR FATHER&#39;S FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, IT&#39;S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE&#39;LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME.&quot;<br /> <br /> A ringing silence fell. The red envelope, which had dropped from Ron&#39;s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over them. A few people laughed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke out again.<br /> <br /> Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the top of Ron&#39;s head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you expected, Ron, but you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t tell me I deserved it,&quot; snapped Ron.<br /> <br /> Harry pushed his porridge away. His insides were burning with guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer...<br /> <br /> But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being perfectly friendly again.<br /> <br /> As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor Sprout&#39;s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.<br /> <br /> Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with gold trimming.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, hello there!&quot; he called, beaming around at the assembled students. &quot;Just been showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don&#39;t want you running away with the idea that I&#39;m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to have met several of these exotic plants on my travels...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Greenhouse three today, chaps!&quot; said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.<br /> <br /> There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart&#39;s hand shot out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry! I&#39;ve been wanting a word - you don&#39;t mind if he&#39;s a couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?&quot;<br /> <br /> Judging by Professor Sprout&#39;s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, &quot;That&#39;s the ticket,&quot; and closed the greenhouse door in her face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry,&quot; said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his head. &quot;Harry, Harry, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.<br /> <br /> &quot;When I heard - well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart went on, &quot;Don&#39;t know when I&#39;ve been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once why you&#39;d done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry .&quot;<br /> <br /> It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he wasn&#39;t talking.<br /> <br /> &quot;Gave you a taste for publicity, didn&#39;t I?&quot; said Lockhart. &quot;Gave you the bug . You got onto the front page of the paper with me and you couldn&#39;t wait to do it again.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no, Professor, see--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, Harry, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. &quot;I understand . Natural to want a bit more once you&#39;ve had that first taste - and I blame myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head - but see here, young man, you can&#39;t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you&#39;re older. Yes, yes, I know what you&#39;re thinking! It&#39;s all right for him, he&#39;s an internationally famous wizard already!&#39;But when I was twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I&#39;d say I was even more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven&#39;t they? All that business with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!&quot; He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry&#39;s forehead. &quot;I know, I know - it&#39;s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly&#39;s Most Charming Smile Award five times in a row, as I have - but it&#39;s a start , Harry, it&#39;s a start .&quot;<br /> <br /> He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside.<br /> <br /> Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place between Ron and Hermione, she said, &quot;We&#39;ll be repotting Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?&quot;<br /> <br /> To nobody&#39;s surprise, Hermione&#39;s hand was first into the air.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,&quot; said Hermione, sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. &quot;It is used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their original state.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,&quot; said Professor Sprout. &quot;The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione&#39;s hand narrowly missed Harry&#39;s glasses as it shot up again.<br /> <br /> &quot;The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,&quot; she said promptly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Precisely. Take another ten points,&quot; said Professor Sprout. &quot;Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.&quot;<br /> <br /> She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn&#39;t have the slightest idea what Hermione meant by the &quot;cry&quot; of the Mandrake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,&quot; said Professor Sprout.<br /> <br /> There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn&#39;t pink and fluffy.<br /> <br /> &quot;When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,&quot; said Professor Sprout. &quot;When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on .&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard.<br /> <br /> Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.<br /> <br /> Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.<br /> <br /> Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs.<br /> <br /> &quot;As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won&#39;t kill yet,&quot; she said calmly as though she&#39;d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. &quot;However, they will knock you out for several hours, and as I&#39;m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Four to a tray - there is a large supply of pots here - compost in the sacks over there - and be careful of the Venemous Tentacula, it&#39;s teething.&quot;<br /> <br /> She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.<br /> <br /> &quot;Justin Finch-Fletchley,&quot; he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. &quot;Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter... And you&#39;re Hermione Granger - always top in everything&quot; (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) &quot;- and Ron Weasley. Wasn&#39;t that your flying car?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron didn&#39;t smile. The Howler was obviously still on his mind.<br /> <br /> &quot;That Lockhart&#39;s something, isn&#39;t he?&quot; said Justin happily as they began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. &quot;Awfully brave chap. Have you read his books? I&#39;d have died of fear if Id been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - zap - just fantastic .<br /> <br /> &quot;My name was down for Eton, you know. I can&#39;t tell you how glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly disappointed, but since I made her read Lockhart&#39;s books I think she&#39;s begun to see how useful it&#39;ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the family...&quot;<br /> <br /> After that they didn&#39;t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn&#39;t. The Mandrakes didn&#39;t like coming out of the earth, but didn&#39;t seem to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.<br /> <br /> By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors hurried off to Transfiguration.<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall&#39;s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.<br /> <br /> Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn&#39;t pleased.<br /> <br /> Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stupid - useless - thing--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Write home for another one,&quot; Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like a firecracker.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,&quot; said Ron, stuffing the now hissing wand into his bag. &quot; It&#39;s your own fault your wand got snapped -&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> They went down to lunch, where Ron&#39;s mood was not improved by Hermione&#39;s showing them the handful of perfect coat buttons she had produced in Transfiguration.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;ve we got this afternoon?&quot; said Harry, hastily changing the subject.<br /> <br /> &quot;Defense Against the Dark Arts,&quot; said Hermione at once.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why , &quot;demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, &quot;have you outlined all Lockhart&#39;s lessons in little hearts?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.<br /> <br /> They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he&#39;d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at him, he went bright red.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, Harry? I&#39;m - I&#39;m Colin Creevey,&quot; he said breathlessly, taking a tentative step forward. &quot;I&#39;m in Gryffindor, too. D&#39;you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture?&quot; he said, raising the camera hopefully.<br /> <br /> &quot;A picture?&quot; Harry repeated blankly.<br /> <br /> &quot;So I can prove I&#39;ve met you,&quot; said Colin Creevey eagerly, edging further forward. &quot;I know all about you. Everyone&#39;s told me. About how you survived when You-Know-Who tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you&#39;ve still got a lightning scar on your forehead&quot; (his eyes raked Harry&#39;s hairline) &quot;and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion, the pictures&#39;ll move .&quot; Colin drew a great shuddering breath of excitement and said, &quot;It&#39;s amazing here, isn&#39;t it? I never knew all the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hogwarts. My dad&#39;s a milkman, he couldn&#39;t believe it either. So I&#39;m taking loads of pictures to send home to him. And it&#39;d be really good if I had one of you&quot; - he looked imploringly at Harry - &quot;maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you? And then, could you sign it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Signed photos? You&#39;re giving out signed photos , Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy&#39;s voice echoed around the courtyard. He had stopped right behind Colin, flanked, as he always was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggish cronies, Crabbe and Goyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Everyone line up!&quot; Malfoy roared to the crowd. &quot;Harry Potter&#39;s giving out signed photos!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. &quot;Shut up, Malfoy.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re just jealous,&quot; piped up Colin, whose entire body was about as thick as Crabbe&#39;s neck.<br /> <br /> &quot;Jealous?&quot; said Malfoy, who didn&#39;t need to shout anymore: half the courtyard was listening in. &quot;Of what? I don&#39;t want a foul scar right across my head, thanks. I don&#39;t think getting your head cut open makes you that special, myself.&quot;<br /> <br /> Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Eat slugs, Malfoy,&quot; said Ron angrily. Crabbe stopped laughing and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way.<br /> <br /> &quot;Be careful, Weasley,&quot; sneered Malfoy. &quot;You don&#39;t want to start any trouble or your Mommy&#39;ll have to come and take you away from school.&quot; He put on a shrill, piercing voice. &quot; If you put another toe out of line<br /> <br /> --&quot;<br /> <br /> A knot of Slytherin fifth-years nearby laughed loudly at this.<br /> <br /> &quot;Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,&quot; smirked Malfoy. &quot;It&#39;d be worth more than his family&#39;s whole house--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, &quot;Look out!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s all this, what&#39;s all this?&quot; Gilderoy Lockhart was striding toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. &quot;Who&#39;s giving out signed photos?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lockhart flung an arm around his shoulders and thundered jovially, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t have asked! We meet again, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> Pinned to Lockhart&#39;s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on then, Mr. Creevey,&quot; said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. &quot;A double portrait, can&#39;t do better than that, and we&#39;ll both sign it for you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Colin fumbled for his camera and took the picture as the bell rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Off you go, move along there,&quot; Lockhart called to the crowd, and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side.<br /> <br /> &quot;A word to the wise, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart paternally as they entered the building through a side door. &quot;I covered up for you back there with young Creevey - if he was photographing me, too, your schoolmates won&#39;t think you&#39;re setting yourself up so much...&quot;<br /> <br /> Deaf to Harry&#39;s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor lined with staring students and up a staircase.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of your career isn&#39;t sensible - looks a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you&#39;ll need to keep a stack handy wherever you go, but&quot; - he gave a little chortle - &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re quite there yet.&quot;<br /> <br /> They had reached Lockhart&#39;s classroom and he let Harry go at last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the very back of the class, where he busied himself with piling all seven of Lockhart&#39;s books in front of him, so that he could avoid looking at the real thing.<br /> <br /> The rest of the class came clattering in, and Ron and Hermione sat down on either side of Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You could&#39;ve fried an egg on your face&quot; said Ron. &quot;You&#39;d better hope Creevey doesn&#39;t meet Ginny, or they&#39;ll be starting a Harry Potter fan club.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up,&quot; snapped Harry. The last thing he needed was for Lockhart to hear the phrase &quot;Harry Potter fan club&quot;<br /> <br /> When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat loudly and silence fell. He reached forward, picked up Neville Longbottom&#39;s copy of Travels with Trolls , and held it up to show his own, winking portrait on the front.<br /> <br /> &quot;Me,&quot; he said, pointing at it and winking as well. &quot;Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly&#39;s Most Charming Smile Award but I don&#39;t talk about that. I didn&#39;t get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!&quot;<br /> <br /> He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly.<br /> <br /> &quot;I see you&#39;ve all bought a complete set of my books - well done. I thought we&#39;d start today with a little quiz. Nothing to worry about - just to check how well you&#39;ve read them, how much you&#39;ve taken in--&quot;<br /> <br /> When he had handed out the test papers he returned to the front of the class and said, &quot;You have thirty minutes - start - now!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked down at his paper and read:<br /> <br /> <br /> 1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart s favorite color?<br /> <br /> 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s secret ambition?<br /> <br /> 3. What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s greatest achievement to date?<br /> <br /> On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to:<br /> <br /> 54. When is Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s birthday, and what would his ideal gift be?<br /> <br /> Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled through them in front of the class.<br /> <br /> &quot;Tut, tut - hardly any of you remembered that my favorite color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti . And a few of you need to read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully - I clearly state in chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony between all magic and non-magic peoples - though I wouldn&#39;t say no to a large bottle of Ogdeds Old Firewhisky!&quot;<br /> <br /> He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at Lockhart with an expression of disbelief on his face; Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were sitting in front, were shaking with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to Lockhart with rapt attention and gave a start when he mentioned her name.<br /> <br /> &quot;... but Miss Hermione Granger knew my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care potions - good girl! In fact&quot; - he flipped her paper over - &quot;full marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione raised a trembling hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excellent!&quot; beamed Lockhart. &quot;Quite excellent! Take ten points for Gryffindor! And so - to business--&quot;<br /> <br /> He bent down behind his desk and lifted a large, covered cage onto it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now - be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. All I ask is that you remain calm.&quot;<br /> <br /> In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a better look at the cage. Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean and Seamus had stopped laughing now. Neville was cowering in his front row seat.<br /> <br /> &quot;I must ask you not to scream,&quot; said Lockhart in a low voice. &quot;It might provoke them.&quot;<br /> <br /> As the whole class held its breath, Lockhart whipped off the cover.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; he said dramatically. &quot;Freshly caught Cornish pixies.&quot;<br /> <br /> Seamus Finnigan couldn&#39;t control himself. He let out a snort of laughter that even Lockhart couldn&#39;t mistake for a scream of terror.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes?&quot; He smiled at Seamus.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, they&#39;re not - they&#39;re not very - dangerous , are they?&quot; Seamus choked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be so sure!&quot; said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at Seamus. &quot;Devilish tricky little blighters they can be!&quot;<br /> <br /> The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering and rocketing around, rattling the bars and making bizarre faces at the people nearest them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Right, then,&quot; Lockhart said loudly. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you make of them!&quot; And he opened the cage.<br /> <br /> It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and Neville was swinging from the iron chandelier in the ceiling.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on now - round them up, round them up, they&#39;re only pixies,&quot; Lockhart shouted.<br /> <br /> He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, &quot; Peskipiksi Pesternomi! &quot;<br /> <br /> It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.<br /> <br /> The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.&quot; He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you believe him?&quot; roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on the ear.<br /> <br /> &quot;He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,&quot; said Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hands on ? &quot;said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its tongue out. &quot;Hermione, he didn&#39;t have a clue what he was doing--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubbish,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;You&#39;ve read his books - look at all those amazing things he&#39;s done--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He says he&#39;s done,&quot; Ron muttered.</p> "

          "title": "Mudbloods and Murmurs",
          "content": "<p> Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry&#39;s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, &quot;All right, Harry?&quot; six or seven times a day and hear, &quot;Hello, Colin,&quot; back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.<br /> <br /> Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron&#39;s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron&#39;s hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.<br /> <br /> &quot;Whassamatter?&quot; said Harry groggily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Quidditch practice!&quot; said Wood. &quot;Come on!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn&#39;t understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were making.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oliver,&quot; Harry croaked. &quot;It&#39;s the crack of dawn.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Exactly,&quot; said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. &quot;It&#39;s part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let&#39;s go,&quot; said Wood heartily. &quot;None of the other teams have started training yet; we&#39;re going to be first off the mark this year--&quot;<br /> <br /> Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good man,&quot; said Wood. &quot;Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.&quot;<br /> <br /> When he&#39;d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he&#39;d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I&#39;ve got here! I&#39;ve had it developed, I wanted to show you--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose.<br /> <br /> A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped, Panting, against the white edge of the picture.<br /> <br /> &quot;Will you sign it?&quot; said Colin eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted. &quot;Sorry, Colin, I&#39;m in a hurry - Quidditch practice--&quot;<br /> <br /> He climbed through the portrait hole.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, wow! Wait for me! I&#39;ve never watched a Quidditch game before!&quot;<br /> <br /> Colin scrambled through the hole after him.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;ll be really boring,&quot; Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with excitement.<br /> <br /> &quot;You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren&#39;t you, Harry? Weren&#39;t you?&quot; said Colin, trotting alongside him. &quot;You must be brilliant. I&#39;ve never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative shadow.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t really understand Quidditch,&quot; said Colin breathlessly. &quot;Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. &quot;They&#39;re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what are the other balls for?&quot; Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, the Quaffle - that&#39;s the biggish red one - is the one that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - they&#39;re three long poles with hoops on the end.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And the fourth ball--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;- is the Golden Snitch,&quot; said Harry, &quot;and it&#39;s very small, very fast, and difficult to catch. But that&#39;s what the Seeker&#39;s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn&#39;t end until the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team&#39;s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And you&#39;re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren&#39;t you?&quot; said Colin in awe.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. &quot;And there&#39;s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That&#39;s it, really.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Colin didn&#39;t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, &quot;I&#39;ll go and get a good seat, Harry!&quot; and hurried off to the stands.<br /> <br /> The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.<br /> <br /> &quot;There you are, Harry, what kept you?&quot; said Wood briskly. &quot;Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference...&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley&#39;s head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet&#39;s shoulder and he began to snore.<br /> <br /> The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on.<br /> <br /> &quot;So,&quot; said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. &quot;Is that clear? Any questions?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve got a question, Oliver,&quot; said George, who had woken with a start. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood wasn&#39;t pleased.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, listen here, you lot,&quot; he said, glowering at them all. &quot;We should have won the Quidditch cup last year. We&#39;re easily the best team. But unfortunately - owing to circumstances beyond our control--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.<br /> <br /> Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still torturing him.<br /> <br /> &quot;So this year, we train harder than ever before... Okay, let&#39;s go and put our new theories into practice!&quot; Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.<br /> <br /> They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aren&#39;t you finished yet?&quot; called Ron incredulously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Haven&#39;t even started,&quot; said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. &quot;Wood&#39;s been teaching us new moves.&quot;<br /> <br /> He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood&#39;s long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, racing Fred and George.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that funny clicking noise?&quot; called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.<br /> <br /> Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look this way, Harry! This way!&quot; he cried shrilly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; said Fred.<br /> <br /> &quot;No idea,&quot; Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible from Colin.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them. &quot;Why&#39;s that first year taking pictures? I don&#39;t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying to find out about our new training program.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He&#39;s in Gryffindor,&quot; said Harry quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;And the Slytherins don&#39;t need a spy, Oliver,&quot; said George.<br /> <br /> &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; said Wood testily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Because they&#39;re here in person,&quot; said George, pointing.<br /> <br /> Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; Wood hissed in outrage. &quot;I booked the field for today! We&#39;ll see about this!&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Flint!&quot; Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. &quot;This is our practice time! We got up specially! You can clear off now!&quot;<br /> <br /> Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as he replied, &quot;Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.&quot;<br /> <br /> Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.<br /> <br /> &quot;But I booked the field!&quot; said Wood, positively spitting with rage. &quot;I booked it!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah,&quot; said Flint. &quot;But I&#39;ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to train their new Seeker&#39;. &quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve got a new Seeker?&quot; said Wood, distracted. &quot;Where?&quot;<br /> <br /> And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aren&#39;t you Lucius Malfoy&#39;s son?&quot; said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.<br /> <br /> &quot;Funny you should mention Draco&#39;s father,&quot; said Flint as the whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. &quot;Let me show you the generous gift he&#39;s made to the Slytherin team.&quot;<br /> <br /> All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under the Gryffindors&#39;noses in the early morning sun.<br /> <br /> &quot;Very latest model. Only came out last month,&quot; said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of dust from the end of his own. &quot;I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps&quot; - he smiled nastily at Fred and George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives -&quot; sweeps the board with them.&quot;<br /> <br /> None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, look,&quot; said Flint. &quot;A field invasion.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Ron asked Harry. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you playing? And what&#39;s he doing here?&quot;<br /> <br /> He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,&quot; said Malfoy, smugly. &quot;Everyone&#39;s just been admiring the brooms my father&#39;s bought our team.<br /> <br /> Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good, aren&#39;t they?&quot; said Malfoy smoothly. &quot;But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Slytherin team howled with laughter.<br /> <br /> &quot;At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in,&quot; said Hermione sharply. &quot; They got in on pure talent.&quot;<br /> <br /> The smug look on Malfoy&#39;s face flickered.<br /> <br /> &quot;No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,&quot; he spat.<br /> <br /> Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, &quot;How dare you!&quot; and Ron plunged his hand into his robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, &quot;You&#39;ll pay for that one, Malfoy!&quot; and pointed it furiously under Flint&#39;s arm at Malfoys face.<br /> <br /> A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong end of Ron&#39;s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron! Ron! Are you all right?&quot; squealed Hermione.<br /> <br /> Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.<br /> <br /> The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist. The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs. Nobody seemed to want to touch him.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;d better get him to Hagrid&#39;s, it&#39;s nearest,&quot; said Harry to Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.<br /> <br /> &quot;What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can&#39;t you?&quot; Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge heave and more slugs dribbled down his front.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oooh,&quot; said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. &quot;Can you hold him still, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Get out of the way, Colin!&quot; said Harry angrily. He and Hermione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds toward the edge of the forest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nearly there, Ron,&quot; said Hermione as the gamekeeper&#39;s cabin came into view. &quot;You&#39;ll be all right in a minute - almost there--&quot;<br /> <br /> They were within twenty feet of Hagrid&#39;s house when the front door opened, but it wasn&#39;t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today, came striding out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Quick, behind here,&quot; Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione followed, somewhat reluctantly.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a simple matter if you know what you&#39;re doing!&quot; Lockhart was saying loudly to Hagrid. &quot;If you need help, you know where I am! I&#39;ll let you have a copy of my book. I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t already got one - I&#39;ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, good-bye!&quot; And he strode away toward the castle.<br /> <br /> Harry waited until Lockhart was out of sight, then pulled Ron out of the bush and up to Hagrid&#39;s front door. They knocked urgently.<br /> <br /> Hagrid appeared at once, looking very grumpy, but his expression brightened when he saw who it was.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bin wonderin&#39;when you&#39;d come ter see me - come in, come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn&#39;t seem perturbed by Ron&#39;s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered Ron into a chair.<br /> <br /> &quot;Better out than in,&quot; he said cheerfully, plunking a large copper basin in front of him. &quot;Get em all up, Ron.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to do except wait for it to stop,&quot; said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. &quot;That&#39;s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a broken wand--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid was bustling around making them tea. His boarhound, Fang, was slobbering over Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?&quot; Harry asked, scratching Fang&#39;s ears.<br /> <br /> &quot;Givin&#39;me advice on gettin&#39;kelpies out of a well,&quot; growled Hagrid, moving a half-plucked rooster off his scrubbed table and setting down the teapot. &quot;Like I don&#39;know. An&#39;bangin&#39;on about some banshee he banished. If one word of it was true, I&#39;ll eat my kettle.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was most unlike Hagrid to criticize a Hogwarts&#39;teacher, and Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a voice somewhat higher than usual, &quot;I think you&#39;re being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He was the on&#39;y man for the job,&quot; said Hagrid, offering them a plate of treacle fudge, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. &quot;An&#39;I mean the on&#39;y one. Gettin&#39;very difficult ter find anyone fer the Dark Arts job. People aren&#39;t too keen ter take it on, see. They&#39;re startin&#39;ter think it&#39;s jinxed. No one&#39;s lasted long fer a while now. So tell me,&quot; said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. &quot;Who was he tryin&#39;ter curse?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy called Hermione something - it must&#39;ve been really bad, because everyone went wild.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was bad,&quot; said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop looking pale and sweaty. &quot;Malfoy called her Mudblood,&#39;Hagrid--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their appearance. Hagrid looked outraged.<br /> <br /> &quot;He didn&#39;!&quot; he growled at Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;He did,&quot; she said. &quot;But I don&#39;t know what it means. I could tell it was really rude, of course--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s about the most insulting thing he could think of,&quot; gasped Ron, coming back up. &quot;Mudblood&#39;s a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know, non-magic parents. There are some wizards - like Malfoy&#39;s family - who think they&#39;re better than everyone else because they&#39;re what people call pure-blood.&quot; He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, &quot;I mean, the rest of us know it doesn&#39;t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom - he&#39;s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;An&#39;they haven&#39;t invented a spell our Hermione can&#39;do,&quot; said Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a disgusting thing to call someone,&quot; said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow with a shaking hand. &quot;Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It&#39;s ridiculous. Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn&#39;t married Muggles we&#39;d&#39;ve died out.&quot;<br /> <br /> He retched and ducked out of sight again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I don&#39;blame yeh fer tryin&#39;ter curse him, Ron,&quot; said Hagrid loudly over the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. &quot;Bu&#39;maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired. Spect Lucius Malfoy would&#39;ve come marchin&#39;up ter school if yeh&#39;d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn&#39;t come much worse than having slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn&#39;t; Hagrid&#39;s treacle fudge had cemented his jaws together.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry,&quot; said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. &quot;Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I&#39;ve heard you&#39;ve bin givin&#39;out signed photos. How come I haven&#39;t got one?&quot;<br /> <br /> Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.<br /> <br /> &quot;I have not been giving out signed photos,&quot; he said hotly. &quot;If Lockhart&#39;s still spreading that around--&quot;<br /> <br /> But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m on&#39;y jokin&#39;,&quot; he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table. &quot;I knew yeh hadn&#39;t really. I told Lockhart yeh didn&#39;need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet he didn&#39;t like that,&quot; said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;think he did,&quot; said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. &quot;An&#39;then I told him I&#39;d never read one o&#39;his books an&#39;he decided ter go. Treacle fudge, Ron?&quot; he added as Ron reappeared.<br /> <br /> &quot;No thanks,&quot; said Ron weakly. &quot;Better not risk it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Come an&#39;see what I&#39;ve bin growin&#39;,&quot; said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.<br /> <br /> In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid&#39;s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.<br /> <br /> &quot;Gettin&#39;on well, aren&#39;t they?&quot; said Hagrid happily. &quot;Fer the Halloween feast... should be big enough by then.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;ve you been feeding them?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I&#39;ve bin givin&#39;them - you know - a bit o&#39;help--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry noticed Hagrid&#39;s flowery pink umbrella leaning against the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before now that this umbrella was not all it looked; in fact, he had the strong impression that Hagrid&#39;s old school wand was concealed inside it. Hagrid wasn&#39;t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why - any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his throat loudly and become mysteriously deaf until the subject was changed.<br /> <br /> &quot;An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?&quot; said Hermione, halfway between disapproval and amusement. &quot;Well, you&#39;ve done a good job on them.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s what yer little sister said,&quot; said Hagrid, nodding at Ron. &quot;Met her jus&#39;yesterday.&quot; Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his beard twitching. &quot;Said she was jus&#39;lookin&#39;round the grounds, but I reckon she was hopin&#39;she might run inter someone else at my house.&quot; He winked at Harry. &quot;If yeh ask me, she wouldn&#39;say no ter a signed--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the ground was sprayed with slugs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Watch it!&quot; Hagrid roared, pulling Ron away from his precious pumpkins.<br /> <br /> It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of treacle fudge since dawn, he was keen to go back to school to eat. They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs.<br /> <br /> They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang out, &quot;There you are, Potter - Weasley.&quot; Professor McGonagall was walking toward them, looking stern. &quot;You will both do your detentions this evening.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;re we doing, Professor?&quot; said Ron, nervously suppressing a burp.<br /> <br /> &quot;You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student in the school.<br /> <br /> &quot;And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan mail,&quot; said Professor McGonagall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh n- Professor, can&#39;t I go and do the trophy room, too?&quot; said Harry desperately.<br /> <br /> &quot;Certainly not,&quot; said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. &quot;Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o&#39;clock sharp, both of you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school-rules sort of expression. Harry didn&#39;t enjoy his shepherd&#39;s pie as much as he&#39;d thought. Both he and Ron felt they&#39;d got the worse deal.<br /> <br /> &quot;Filch&#39;ll have me there all night,&quot; said Ron heavily. &quot;No magic! There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I&#39;m no good at Muggle cleaning.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;d swap anytime,&quot; said Harry hollowly. &quot;I&#39;ve had loads of practice with the Dursleys. Answering Lockhart&#39;s fan mail... he&#39;ll be a nightmare...&quot;<br /> <br /> Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart&#39;s office. He gritted his teeth and knocked.<br /> <br /> The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, here&#39;s the scalawag!&quot; he said. &quot;Come in, Harry, come in--&quot;<br /> <br /> Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few of them. Another large pile lay on his desk.<br /> <br /> &quot;You can address the envelopes!&quot; Lockhart told Harry, as though this was a huge treat.<br /> <br /> &quot;This first one&#39;s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - huge fan of mine--&quot;<br /> <br /> The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart&#39;s voice wash over him, occasionally saying, &quot;Mmm&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; and &quot;Yeah.&quot; Now and then he caught a phrase like, &quot;Fame&#39;s a fickle friend, Harry,&quot; or &quot;Celebrity is as celebrity does, remember that.&quot;<br /> <br /> The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out Veronica Smethley&#39;s address. It must be nearly time to leave , Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time...<br /> <br /> And then he heard something - something quite apart from the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart&#39;s prattle about his fans.<br /> <br /> It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breathtaking, ice-cold venom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come... come to me... Let me rip you... Let me tear you... Let me kill you...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica Smethley&#39;s street.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; he said loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;I know!&quot; said Lockhart. &quot;Six solid months at the top of the best-seller list! Broke all records!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry frantically. &quot;That voice!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry?&quot; said Lockhart, looking puzzled. &quot;What voice?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That - that voice that said - didn&#39;t you hear it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you&#39;re getting a little drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We&#39;ve been here nearly four hours! I&#39;d never have believed it - the time&#39;s flown, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn&#39;t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, Harry left.<br /> <br /> It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn&#39;t back yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into the darkened room.<br /> <br /> &quot;My muscles have all seized up,&quot; he groaned, sinking on his bed. &quot;Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was it with Lockhart?&quot;<br /> <br /> Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard.<br /> <br /> &quot;And Lockhart said he couldn&#39;t hear it?&quot; said Ron. Harry could see him frowning in the moonlight. &quot;D&#39;you think he was lying? But I don&#39;t get it - even someone invisible would&#39;ve had to open the door.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know,&quot; said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at the canopy above him. &quot;I don&#39;t get it either.&quot;<br /></p>"

          "id": 8,
          "title": "The Deathday Party",
          "content": "<p> October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid&#39;s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood&#39;s enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.<br /> <br /> Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn&#39;t been a happy practice session. Fred and George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, &quot;...don&#39;t fulfill their requirements... half an inch, if that...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello, Nick,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello, hello,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.<br /> <br /> &quot;You look troubled, young Potter,&quot; said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet.<br /> <br /> &quot;So do you,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah,&quot; Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, &quot;a matter of no importance... It&#39;s not as though I really wanted to join... Thought I&#39;d apply, but apparently I don&#39;t fulfill requirements&#39;-&quot;<br /> <br /> In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.<br /> <br /> &quot;But you would think, wouldn&#39;t you,&quot; he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of his pocket, &quot;that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh - yes,&quot; said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.<br /> <br /> &quot;I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However -&quot; Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:<br /> <br /> &quot;We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.<br /> <br /> &quot;Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think that&#39;s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it&#39;s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-Podmore.&quot;<br /> <br /> Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, &quot;So - what&#39;s bothering you? Anything I can do?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry. &quot;Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly-&quot;<br /> <br /> The rest of Harry&#39;s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better get out of here, Harry,&quot; said Nick quickly. &quot;Filch isn&#39;t in a good mood - he&#39;s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He&#39;s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry&#39;s right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple.<br /> <br /> &quot;Filth!&quot; he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry&#39;s Quidditch robes. &quot;Mess and muck everywhere! I&#39;ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!&quot;<br /> <br /> So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never been inside Filch&#39;s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind Filch&#39;s desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling.<br /> <br /> Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for parchment.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dung,&quot; he muttered furiously, &quot;great sizzling dragon bogies... frog brains... rat intestines... I&#39;ve had enough of it... make an example... where&#39;s the form... yes...&quot;<br /> <br /> He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot.<br /> <br /> &quot;Name... Harry Potter. Crime...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was only a bit of mud!&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it&#39;s an extra hour scrubbing!&quot; shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. &quot; Crime... befouling the castle... suggested sentence...&quot;<br /> <br /> Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.<br /> <br /> But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle.<br /> <br /> &quot;PEEVES!&quot; Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. &quot;I&#39;ll have you this time, I&#39;ll have you!&quot;<br /> <br /> And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him.<br /> <br /> Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause havoc and distress. Harry didn&#39;t much like Peeves, but couldn&#39;t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he&#39;d wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry.<br /> <br /> Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch wasn&#39;t on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read:<br /> <br /> Kwikspell<br /> <br /> A Correspondence Course in Beginners&#39;Magic.<br /> <br /> Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said:<br /> <br /> <br /> Feel out of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork?<br /> <br /> There is an answer!<br /> <br /> Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell method!<br /> <br /> Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes:<br /> <br /> &quot;I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!&quot;<br /> <br /> Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says:<br /> <br /> &quot;My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, Kwikspell!&quot;<br /> <br /> Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope&#39;s contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn&#39;t a proper wizard? Harry was just reading &quot;Lesson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)&quot; when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it back onto the desk just as the door opened.<br /> <br /> Filch was looking triumphant.<br /> <br /> &quot;That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!&quot; he was saying gleefully to Mrs. Norris. &quot;We&#39;ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet--&quot;<br /> <br /> His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started.<br /> <br /> Filch&#39;s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it into a drawer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you - did you read -?&quot; he sputtered.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; Harry lied quickly.<br /> <br /> Filch&#39;s knobbly hands were twisting together.<br /> <br /> &quot;If I thought you&#39;d read my private -not that it&#39;s mine - for a friend - be that as it may - however--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn&#39;t help.<br /> <br /> &quot;Very well - go - and don&#39;t breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn&#39;t read - go now, I have to write up Peeves&#39;report - go--&quot;<br /> <br /> Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back upstairs. To escape from Filch&#39;s office without punishment was probably some kind of school record.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry! Harry! Did it work?&quot;<br /> <br /> Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height.<br /> <br /> &quot;I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch&#39;s office,&quot; said Nick eagerly. &quot;Thought it might distract him--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Was that you?&quot; said Harry gratefully. &quot;Yeah, it worked, I didn&#39;t even get detention. Thanks, Nick!&quot;<br /> <br /> They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick&#39;s rejection letter...<br /> <br /> &quot;I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,&quot; Harry said. Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through him. He wished he hadn&#39;t; it was like stepping through an icy shower.<br /> <br /> &quot;But there is something you could do for me,&quot; said Nick excitedly. &quot;Harry - would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn&#39;t want--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What is it?&quot; said Harry. &quot;Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. &quot;Right.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of course - but I daresay you&#39;d rather go to the school feast?&quot; He watched Harry on tenterhooks.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry quickly, &quot;I&#39;ll come--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And -&quot; he hesitated, looking excited &quot;- do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you find me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of - of course,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;A deathday party?&quot; said Hermione keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. &quot;I bet there aren&#39;t many living people who can say they&#39;ve been to one of those - it&#39;ll be fascinating!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?&quot; said Ron, who was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. &quot;Sounds dead depressing to me...&quot;<br /> <br /> Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had &quot;rescued&quot; the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious people.<br /> <br /> Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander&#39;s mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell envelope from Harry&#39;s mind.<br /> <br /> By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid&#39;s vast pumpkins had been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.<br /> <br /> &quot;A promise is a promise,&quot; Hermione reminded Harry bossily. &quot;You said you&#39;d go to the deathday party.&quot;<br /> <br /> So at seven o&#39;clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.<br /> <br /> The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s party had been lined with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is that supposed to be music?&quot; Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear friends,&quot; he said mournfully. &quot;Welcome, welcome... so pleased you could come...&quot;<br /> <br /> He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.<br /> <br /> It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.<br /> <br /> &quot;Shall we have a look around?&quot; Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Careful not to walk through anyone,&quot; said Ron nervously, and they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn&#39;t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Hermione, stopping abruptly. &quot;Turn back, turn back, I don&#39;t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who?&quot; said Harry as they backtracked quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;She haunts one of the toilets in the girls&#39;bathroom on the first floor,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;She haunts a toilet?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes. It&#39;s been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it&#39;s awful trying to have a pee with her wailing at you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Look, food!&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words,<br /> <br /> SIR NICHOLAS DE MIMSY-PORPINGTON<br /> <br /> DIED 31ST OCTOBER, 1492<br /> <br /> Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through one of the stinking salmon.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can you taste it if you walk though it?&quot; Harry asked him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Almost,&quot; said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away.<br /> <br /> &quot;I expect they&#39;ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,&quot; said Hermione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid haggis.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can we move? I feel sick,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello, Peeves,&quot; said Harry cautiously.<br /> <br /> Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nibbles?&quot; he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in fungus.<br /> <br /> &quot;No thanks,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,&quot; said Peeves, his eyes dancing. &quot; Rude you was about poor Myrtle.&quot; He took a deep breath and bellowed, &quot;OY! MYRTLE!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no, Peeves, don&#39;t tell her what I said, she&#39;ll be really upset,&quot; Hermione whispered frantically. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it, I don&#39;t mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.&quot;<br /> <br /> The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; she said sulkily.<br /> <br /> &quot;How are you, Myrtle?&quot; said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. &quot;It&#39;s nice to see you out of the toilet.&quot;<br /> <br /> Myrtle sniffed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Miss Granger was just talking about you -&quot; said Peeves slyly in Myrtle&#39;s ear. &quot;Just saying--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,&quot; said Hermione, glaring at Peeves.<br /> <br /> Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re making fun of me,&quot; she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her small, see-through eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;No - honestly - didn&#39;t I just say how nice Myrtle&#39;s looking?&quot; said Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;She did--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t lie to me,&quot; Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. &quot;D&#39;you think I don&#39;t know what people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve forgotten pimply,&quot; Peeves hissed in her ear.<br /> <br /> Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, &quot; Pimply! Pimply! &quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Hermione sadly.<br /> <br /> Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd.<br /> <br /> &quot;Enjoying yourselves?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; they lied.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not a bad turnout,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. &quot;The Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent... It&#39;s nearly time for my speech, I&#39;d better go and warn the orchestra...&quot;<br /> <br /> The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, here we go,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly.<br /> <br /> Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, squashing his head back onto his neck.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nick!&quot; he roared. &quot;How are you? Head still hanging in there?&quot;<br /> <br /> He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder.<br /> <br /> &quot;Welcome, Patrick,&quot; said Nick stiffly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Live uns!&quot; said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd howled with laughter).<br /> <br /> &quot;Very amusing,&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick darkly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t mind Nick!&quot; shouted Sir Patrick&#39;s head from the floor. &quot;Still upset we won&#39;t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I think,&quot; said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, &quot;Nick&#39;s very - frightening and - er--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ha!&quot; yelled Sir Patrick&#39;s head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bet he asked you to say that!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If I could have everyone&#39;s attention, it&#39;s time for my speech!&quot; said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy blue spotlight.<br /> <br /> &quot;My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow...&quot;<br /> <br /> But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick&#39;s head went sailing past him to loud cheers.<br /> <br /> Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I can&#39;t stand much more of this,&quot; Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Harry agreed.<br /> <br /> They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of black candles.<br /> <br /> &quot;Pudding might not be finished yet,&quot; said Ron hopefully, leading the way toward the steps to the entrance hall.<br /> <br /> And then Harry heard it.<br /> <br /> &quot;... rip... tear... kill...&quot;<br /> <br /> It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in Lockhart&#39;s office.<br /> <br /> He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, what&#39;re you -?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s that voice again - shut up a minute--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;... soo hungry... for so long...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Listen!&quot; said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him.<br /> <br /> &quot;... kill... time to kill...&quot;<br /> <br /> The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn&#39;t matter?<br /> <br /> &quot;This way,&quot; he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, what&#39;re we--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;SHH!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter still, he heard the voice: &quot;... I smell blood... I SMELL BLOOD!&quot;<br /> <br /> His stomach lurched--<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s going to kill someone!&quot; he shouted, and ignoring Ron&#39;s and Hermione&#39;s bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps - Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry, what was that all about?&quot; said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. &quot;I couldn&#39;t hear anything...&quot;<br /> <br /> But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look! &quot;<br /> <br /> Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming torches.<br /> <br /> THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN<br /> <br /> OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that thing - hanging underneath?&quot; said Ron, a slight quiver in his voice.<br /> <br /> As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash.<br /> <br /> Mrs. Norris, the caretaker&#39;s cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring.<br /> <br /> For a few seconds, they didn&#39;t move. Then Ron said, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we try and help -&quot; Harry began awkwardly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Trust me,&quot; said Ron. &quot;We don&#39;t want to be found here.&quot;<br /> <br /> But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the passage from both ends.<br /> <br /> The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight.<br /> <br /> Then someone shouted through the quiet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Enemies of the Heir, beware! You&#39;ll be next, Mudbloods!&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat.</p> "

          "content": "<p> What&#39;s going on here? What&#39;s going on?&quot;<br /> <br /> Attracted no doubt by Malfoy&#39;s shout, Argus Filch came shouldering his way through the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. Norris and fell back, clutching his face in horror.<br /> <br /> &quot;My cat! My cat! What&#39;s happened to Mrs. Norris?&quot; he shrieked.<br /> <br /> And his popping eyes fell on Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;You!&quot;he screeched. &quot; You ! You&#39;ve murdered my cat! You&#39;ve killed her! I&#39;ll kill you! I&#39;ll--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Argus!&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of other teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come with me, Argus,&quot; he said to Filch. &quot;You, too, Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.&quot;<br /> <br /> Lockhart stepped forward eagerly.<br /> <br /> &quot;My office is nearest, Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Thank you, Gilderoy,&quot; said Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockhart, looking excited and important, hurried after Dumbledore; so did Professors McGonagall and Snape.<br /> <br /> As they entered Lockhart&#39;s darkened office there was a flurry of movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore lay Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged tense looks and sank into chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching.<br /> <br /> The tip of Dumbledore&#39;s long, crooked nose was barely an inch from Mrs. Norris&#39;s fur. He was looking at her closely through his half-moon spectacles, his long fingers gently prodding and poking. Professor McGonagall was bent almost as close, her eyes narrowed. Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most peculiar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making suggestions.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was definitely a curse that killed her - probably the Transmogrifian Torture - I&#39;ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I wasn&#39;t there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her...&quot;<br /> <br /> Lockhart&#39;s comments were punctuated by Filch&#39;s dry, racking sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry couldn&#39;t help feeling a bit sorry for him, though not nearly as sorry as he felt for himself If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be expelled for sure.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened. She continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed.<br /> <br /> &quot;...I remember something very similar happening in Ouagadogou,&quot; said Lockhart, &quot;a series of attacks, the full story&#39;s in my autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various amulets, which cleared the matter up at once...&quot;<br /> <br /> The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in agreement as he talked. One of them had forgotten to remove his hair net.<br /> <br /> At last Dumbledore straightened up.<br /> <br /> &quot;She&#39;s not dead, Argus,&quot; he said softly.<br /> <br /> Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the number of murders he had prevented.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not dead?&quot; choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. &quot;But why&#39;s she all - all stiff and frozen?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;She has been Petrified,&quot; said Dumbledore (&quot;Ah! I thought so!&quot; said Lockhart). &quot;But how, I cannot say...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ask him!&quot; shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained face to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;No second year could have done this,&quot; said Dumbledore firmly. &quot;it would take Dark Magic of the most advanced--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He did it, he did it!&quot; Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. &quot;You saw what he wrote on the wall! He found - in my office - he knows I&#39;m a - I&#39;m a -&quot; Filch&#39;s face worked horribly. &quot;He knows I&#39;m a Squib!&quot; he finished.<br /> <br /> &quot;I never touched Mrs. Norris!&quot; Harry said loudly, uncomfortably aware of everyone looking at him, including all the Lockharts on the walls. &quot;And I don&#39;t even know what a Squib is .&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Rubbish!&quot; snarled Filch. &quot;He saw my Kwikspell letter!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If I might speak, Headmaster,&quot; said Snape from the shadows, and Harry&#39;s sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing Snape had to say was going to do him any good.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; he said, a slight sneer curling his mouth as though he doubted it. &quot;But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here. Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all? Why wasn&#39;t he at the Halloween feast?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron and Hermione all launched into an explanation about the deathday party. &quot;...there were hundreds of ghosts, they&#39;ll tell you we were there--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But why not join the feast afterward?&quot; said Snape, his black eyes glittering in the candlelight. &quot;Why go up to that corridor?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione looked at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Because - because -&quot; Harry said, his heart thumping very fast; something told him it would sound very far-fetched if he told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear, &quot;because we were tired and wanted to go to bed,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Without any supper?&quot; said Snape, a triumphant smile flickering across his gaunt face. &quot;I didn&#39;t think ghosts provided food fit for living people at their parties.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We weren&#39;t hungry,&quot; said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge rumble.<br /> <br /> Snape&#39;s nasty smile widened.<br /> <br /> &quot;I suggest, Headmaster, that Potter is not being entirely truthful,&quot; he said. &quot;It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch team until he is ready to be honest.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Really, Severus,&quot; said Professor McGonagall sharply, &quot;I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn&#39;t hit over the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore was giving Harry a searching look. His twinkling light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Innocent until proven guilty, Severus,&quot; he said firmly.<br /> <br /> Snape looked furious.<br /> <br /> So did Filch.<br /> <br /> &quot;My cat has been Petrified!&quot; he shrieked, his eyes popping. &quot;I want to see some punishment!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We will be able to cure her, Argus,&quot; said Dumbledore patiently. &quot;Professer Sprout recently managed to procure some Mandrakes. As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion made that will revive Mrs. Norris.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll make it,&quot; Lockhart butted in. &quot;I must have done it a hundred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Snape icily. &quot;But I believe I am the Potions master at this school.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was a very awkward pause.<br /> <br /> &quot;You may go,&quot; Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br /> <br /> They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. When they were a floor up from Lockhart&#39;s office, they turned into an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. Harry squinted at his friends&#39;darkened faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Ron, without hesitation. &quot;Hearing voices no one else can hear isn&#39;t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.&quot;<br /> <br /> Something in Ron&#39;s voice made Harry ask, &quot;You do believe me, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Course I do,&quot; said Ron quickly. &quot;But - you must admit it&#39;s weird...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know it&#39;s weird,&quot; said Harry. &quot;The whole thing&#39;s weird. What was that writing on the wall about? The Chamber Has Been Opened ... What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You know, it rings a sort of bell,&quot; said Ron slowly. &quot;I think someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once... might&#39;ve been Bill...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what on earth&#39;s a Squib?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well - it&#39;s not funny really - but as it&#39;s Filch,&quot; he said. &quot;A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn&#39;t got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch&#39;s trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates students so much.&quot; Ron gave a satisfied smile. &quot;He&#39;s bitter.&quot;<br /> <br /> A clock chimed somewhere.<br /> <br /> &quot;Midnight,&quot; said Harry. &quot;We&#39;d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to frame us for something else.&quot;<br /> <br /> For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone&#39;s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message on the wall with Mrs. Skower&#39;s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn&#39;t guarding the scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like &quot;breathing loudly&#39;and &quot;looking happy.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris&#39;s fate. According to Ron, she was a great cat lover.<br /> <br /> &quot;But you haven&#39;t really got to know Mrs. Norris,&quot; Ron told her bracingly. &quot;Honestly, we&#39;re much better off without her.&quot; Ginny&#39;s lip trembled. &quot;Stuff like this doesn&#39;t often happen at Hogwarts,&quot; Ron assured her. &quot;They&#39;ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of here in no time. I just hope he&#39;s got time to Petrify Filch before he&#39;s expelled. I&#39;m only joking -&quot; Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.<br /> <br /> The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and not until the following Wednesday did they find out.<br /> <br /> Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.<br /> <br /> Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three foot long composition on &quot;The Medieval Assembly of European Wizards.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t believe it, I&#39;m still eight inches short said Ron furiously, letting go of his parchment, which sprang back into a roll. &quot;And Hermione&#39;s done four feet seven inches and her writing&#39;s tiny.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Where is she?&quot; asked Harry, grabbing the tape measure and unrolling his own homework.<br /> <br /> &quot;Somewhere over there,&quot; said Ron, pointing along the shelves. &quot;Looking for another book. I think she&#39;s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry told Ron about Justin Finch-Fletchley running away from him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,&quot; said Ron, scribbling away, making his writing as large as possible. &quot;All that junk about Lockhart being so great--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last seemed ready to talk to them.<br /> <br /> &quot;All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,&quot; she said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. &quot;And there&#39;s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn&#39;t left my copy at home, but I couldn&#39;t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why do you want it?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;The same reason everyone else wants it,&quot; said Hermione, &quot;to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; said Harry quickly.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s just it. I can&#39;t remember,&quot; said Hermione, biting her lip. &quot;And I can&#39;t find the story anywhere else--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, let me read your composition,&quot; said Ron desperately, checking his watch.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, I won&#39;t,&quot; said Hermione, suddenly severe. &quot;You&#39;ve had ten days to finish it--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I only need another two inches, come on--&quot;<br /> <br /> The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.<br /> <br /> History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the most exciting thing that ever happened in his classes was his entering the room through the blackboard. Ancient and shriveled, many people said he hadn&#39;t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to teach one day and left his body behind him in an armchair in front of the staff room fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest since.<br /> <br /> Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally coming to long enough to copy down a name or date, then falling asleep again. He had been speaking for half an hour when something happened that had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.<br /> <br /> Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Miss - er -?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; said Hermione in a clear voice.<br /> <br /> Dean Thomas, who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown&#39;s head came up off her arms and Neville Longbottom&#39;s elbow slipped off his desk.<br /> <br /> Professor Binns blinked.<br /> <br /> &quot;My subject is History of Magic,&quot; he said in his dry, wheezy voice. &quot;I deal with facts , Miss Granger, not myths and legends.&quot; He cleared his throat with a small noise like chalk slipping and continued, &quot;In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers--&quot;<br /> <br /> He stuttered to a halt. Hermione&#39;s hand was waving in the air again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Miss Grant?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Please, sir, don&#39;t legends always have a basis in fact?&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry was sure no student had ever interrupted him before, alive or dead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well,&quot; said Professor Binns slowly, &quot;yes, one could argue that, I suppose.&quot; He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a student properly before. &quot;However, the legend of which you speak is such a very sensational , even ludicrous tale--&quot;<br /> <br /> But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns&#39;s every word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of interest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, very well,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Let me see... the Chamber of Secrets...<br /> <br /> &quot;You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago - the precise date is uncertain - by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution.&quot;<br /> <br /> He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.<br /> <br /> &quot;For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor, and Slytherin left the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.<br /> <br /> &quot;Reliable historical sources tell us this much,&quot; he said. &quot;But these honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing.<br /> <br /> &quot;Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.&quot;<br /> <br />  There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn&#39;t the usual, sleepy silence that filled Professor Binns&#39;s classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to watch him, hoping for more. Professor Binns looked faintly annoyed.<br /> <br /> &quot;The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,&quot; he said. &quot;Naturally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione&#39;s hand was back in the air.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sir - what exactly do you mean by the horror within&#39;the Chamber?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of Slytherin alone can control,&quot; said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy voice.<br /> <br /> The class exchanged nervous looks.<br /> <br /> &quot;I tell you, the thing does not exist,&quot; said Professor Binns, shuffling his notes. &quot;There is no Chamber and no monster.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But, sir,&quot; said Seamus Finnigan, &quot;if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin&#39;s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, would they?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Nonsense, O&#39;Flaherty,&quot; said Professor Binns in an aggravated tone. &quot;If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and headmistresses haven&#39;t found the thing--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But, Professor,&quot; piped up Parvati Patil, &quot;you&#39;d probably have to use Dark Magic to open it--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just because a wizard doesn&#39;t use Dark Magic doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t , Miss Pennyfeather,&quot; snapped Professor Binns. &quot;I repeat, if the likes of Dumbledore--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But maybe you&#39;ve got to be related to Slytherin, so Dumbledore couldn&#39;t -&quot; began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough.<br /> <br /> &quot;That will do,&quot; he said sharply. &quot;It is a myth! It does not exist! There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! We will return, if you please, to history , to solid, believable, verifiable fact!&quot;<br /> <br /> And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual torpor.<br /> <br /> &quot;I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,&quot; Ron told Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. &quot;But I never knew he started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn&#39;t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I&#39;d&#39;ve got the train straight back home...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn&#39;t say anything. His stomach had just dropped unpleasantly.<br /> <br /> Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could remember, as though it were yesterday, the small voice that had spoken in his ear when he&#39;d placed the hat on his head a year before : You could be great, you know, it&#39;s all here in your head, and Slytherin would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that...<br /> <br /> But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House&#39;s reputation for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not Slytherin! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you&#39;re sure... better be Gryffindor ...<br /> <br /> As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevy went past.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hiya, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hullo, Colin,&quot; said Harry automatically.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry - Harry - a boy in my class has been saying you&#39;re--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Colin was so small he couldn&#39;t fight against the tide of people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, &quot;See you, Harry!&quot; and he was gone.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s a boy in his class saying about you?&quot; Hermione wondered.<br /> <br /> &quot;That I&#39;m Slytherin&#39;s heir, I expect,&quot; said Harry, his stomach dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime.<br /> <br /> &quot;People here&#39;ll believe anything,&quot; said Ron in disgust.<br /> <br /> The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next staircase without difficulty.<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you really think there&#39;s a Chamber of Secrets?&quot; Ron asked Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said, frowning. &quot;Dumbledore couldn&#39;t cure Mrs. Norris, and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human.&quot;<br /> <br /> As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been Opened.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s where Filch has been keeping guard,&quot; Ron muttered.<br /> <br /> They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t hurt to have a poke around,&quot; said Harry, dropping his bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl along, searching for clues.<br /> <br /> &quot;Scorch marks!&quot; he said. &quot;Here - and here--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Come and look at this!&quot; said Hermione. &quot;This is funny...&quot;<br /> <br /> Har ry got up and crossed to the window next to the message on the wall. Hermione was pointing at the topmost pane, where around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a rope, as though they had all climbed it in their hurry to get outside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you ever seen spiders act like that?&quot; said Hermione wonderingly.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry, &quot;have you, Ron? Ron?&quot;<br /> <br /> He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and seemed to be fighting the impulse to run.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I - don&#39;t - like - spiders,&quot; said Ron tensely.<br /> <br /> &quot;I never knew that,&quot; said Hermione, looking at Ron in surprise. &quot;You&#39;ve used spiders in Potions loads of times...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t mind them dead,&quot; said Ron, who was carefully looking anywhere but at the window. &quot;I just don&#39;t like the way they move...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione giggled.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not funny,&quot; said Ron, fiercely. &quot;If you must know, when I was three, Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big filthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick... You wouldn&#39;t like them either if you&#39;d been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and...&quot;<br /> <br /> He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying not to laugh. Feeling they had better get off the subject, Harry said, &quot;Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? Someone&#39;s mopped it up.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was about here,&quot; said Ron, recovering himself to walk a few paces past Filch&#39;s chair and pointing. &quot;Level with this door.&quot;<br /> <br /> He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his hand as though he&#39;d been burned.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Can&#39;t go in there,&quot; said Ron gruffly. &quot;That&#39;s a girls&#39;toilet.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Ron, there won&#39;t be anyone in there,&quot; said Hermione standing up and coming over. &quot;That&#39;s Moaning Myrtle&#39;s place. Come on, let&#39;s have a look.&quot;<br /> <br /> And ignoring the large OUT of ORDER sign, she opened the door.<br /> <br /> It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever set foot in. Under a large, cracked, and spotted mirror were a row of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light given off by the stubs of a few candles, burning low in their holders; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and one of them was dangling off its hinges.<br /> <br /> Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end stall. When she reached it she said, &quot;Hello, Myrtle, how are you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron went to look. Moaning Myrtle was floating above the tank of the toilet, picking a spot on her chin.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is a girls<br /> <br /> bathroom,&quot; she said, eyeing Ron and Harry suspiciously. &quot; They&#39;re not girls.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; Hermione agreed. &quot;I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here.&quot;<br /> <br /> She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ask her if she saw anything,&quot; Harry mouthed at Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you whispering?&quot; said Myrtle, staring at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Harry quickly. &quot;We wanted to ask--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I wish people would stop talking behind my back!&quot; said Myrtle, in a voice choked with tears. &quot;I do have feelings, you know, even if I am dead--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Myrtle, no one wants to upset you,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Harry only--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No one wants to upset me! That&#39;s a good one!&quot; howled Myrtle. &quot;My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come along ruining my death!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We wanted to ask you if you&#39;ve seen anything funny lately,&quot; said Hermione quickly. &quot;Because a cat was attacked right outside your front door on Halloween.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you see anyone near here that night?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wasn&#39;t paying attention,&quot; said Myrtle dramatically. &quot;Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself. Then, of course, I remembered that I&#39;m - that I&#39;m--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Already dead,&quot; said Ron helpfully.<br /> <br /> Myrtle gave a tragic sob, rose up in the air, turned over, and dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and vanishing from sight, although from the direction of her muffled sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron stood with their mouths open, but Hermione shrugged wearily and said, &quot;Honestly, that was almost cheerful for Myrtle... Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle&#39;s gurgling sobs when a loud voice made all three of them jump.<br /> <br /> &quot;RON!&quot;<br /> <br /> Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s a girls<br /> <br /> bathroom!&quot; he gasped. &quot;What were you -?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Just having a look around,&quot; Ron shrugged. &quot;Clues, you know--&quot;<br /> <br /> Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of Mrs. Weasley.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get - away - from - there -&quot; Perry said, striding toward them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. &quot;Don&#39;t you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone&#39;s at dinner--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t we be here?&quot; said Ron hotly, stopping short and glaring at Percy. &quot;Listen, we never laid a finger on that cat!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s what I told Ginny,&quot; said Percy fiercely, &quot;but she still seems to think you&#39;re going to be expelled, I&#39;ve never seen her so upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her , all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t care about Ginny,&quot; said Ron, whose ears were now reddening. &quot; You&#39;re just worried I&#39;m going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Five points from Gryffindor!&quot; Percy said tersely, fingering his prefect badge. &quot;And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detective work , or I&#39;ll write to Mum!&quot;<br /> <br /> And he strode off, the back of his neck as red as Ron&#39;s ears.<br /> <br /> Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad temper and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parchment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry&#39;s surprise, Hermione followed suit.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who can it be, though?&quot; she said in a quiet voice, as though continuing a conversation they had just been having. &quot;Who&#39;d want to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwart&#39;s?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s think,&quot; said Ron in mock puzzlement. &quot;Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum?&quot;<br /> <br /> He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced.<br /> <br /> &quot;If you&#39;re talking about Malfoy--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course I am!&quot; said Ron. &quot;You heard him - You&#39;ll be next, Mudbloods!&#39;- come on, you&#39;ve only got to look at his foul rat face to know it&#39;s him--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?&quot; said Hermione skeptically.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look at his family,&quot; said Harry, closing his books, too. &quot;The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he&#39;s always boasting about it. They could easily be Slytherin&#39;s descendants. His father&#39;s definitely evil enough.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;They could&#39;ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries!&quot; said Ron. &quot;Handing it down, father to son ...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well,&quot; said Hermione cautiously, &quot;I suppose it&#39;s possible...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But how do we prove it?&quot; said Harry darkly.<br /> <br /> &quot;There might be a way,&quot; said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a quick glance across the room at Percy. &quot;Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous, very dangerous. We&#39;d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won&#39;t you?&quot; said Ron irritably.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right,&quot; said Hermione coldly. &quot;What we&#39;d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it&#39;s us.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But that&#39;s impossible,&quot; Harry said as Ron laughed.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;All we&#39;d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; said Ron and Harry together.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think we&#39;ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?&quot; muttered Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything. He&#39;s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we could hear him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,&quot; said Ron, frowning. &quot;What if we were stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It wears off after a while,&quot; said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. &quot;But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it&#39;s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.&quot; There was only one way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. &quot;Hard to see why we&#39;d want the book, really,&quot; said Ron, &quot;if we weren&#39;t going to try and make one of the potions.&quot; &quot;I think,&quot; said Hermione, &quot;that if we made it sound as though we were just interested in the theory, we might stand a chance...<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, come on, no teacher&#39;s going to fall for that,&quot; said Ron. &quot;They&#39;d have to be really thick...&quot;</p> "

          "title": "The Rogue Bludger",
          "content": "<p> Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt with him.<br /> <br /> Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he hadn&#39;t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nice loud howl, Harry - exactly - and then, if you&#39;ll believe it, I pounced - like this - slammed him to the floor - thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down - with my other, I put my wand to his throat - I then screwed up my remaining strength and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm- he let out a piteous moan - go on, Harry - higher than that - good - the fur vanished - the fangs shrank - and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective - and another village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.&quot;<br /> <br /> The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Homework - compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!&quot;<br /> <br /> The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the room, where Ron and Hermione were waiting.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready?&quot; Harry muttered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wait till everyone&#39;s gone,&quot; said Hermione nervously. &quot;All right...&quot;<br /> <br /> She approached Lockhart&#39;s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er - Professor Lockhart?&quot; Hermione stammered. &quot;I wanted to - to get this book out of the library. Just for background reading.&quot; She held out the piece of paper, her hand shaking slightly. &quot;But the thing is, it&#39;s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I need a teacher to sign for it - I&#39;m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!&quot; said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling widely at her. &quot;Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Hermione eagerly. &quot;So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, I&#39;m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help,&quot; said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. &quot;Yes, nice, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron&#39;s face. &quot;I usually save it for book-signings.&quot;<br /> <br /> He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;So, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you&#39;re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate my life to the eradication of the Dark Forces. Still, if ever you feel the need for a little private training, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. Always happy to pass on my expertise to less able players...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried off after Ron and Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; he said as the three of them examined the signature on the note. &quot;He didn&#39;t even look at the book we wanted.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s because he&#39;s a brainless git,&quot; said Ron. &quot;But who cares, we&#39;ve got what we needed-&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He is not a brainless git,&quot; said Hermione shrilly as they half ran toward the library.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just because he said you were the best student of the year--&quot;<br /> <br /> They dropped their voices as they entered the muffled stillness of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable woman who looked like an underfed vulture.<br /> <br /> &quot;Moste Potente Potions?&quot; she repeated suspiciously, trying to take the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn&#39;t let go.<br /> <br /> &quot;I was wondering if I could keep it,&quot; she said breathlessly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and thrusting it at Madam Pince. &quot;We&#39;ll get you another autograph. Lockhart&#39;ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.&quot;<br /> <br /> Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several minutes later carrying a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty.<br /> <br /> Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle&#39;s out-of-order bathroom once again. Hermione had overridden Ron&#39;s objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their right minds would go, so they were guaranteed some privacy. Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ignoring her, and she them.<br /> <br /> Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three of them bent over the damp-spotted pages. It was clear from a glance why it belonged in the Restricted Section. Some of the potions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting several extra pairs of arms out of her head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Here it is,&quot; said Hermione excitedly as she found the page headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their faces.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is the most complicated potion I&#39;ve ever seen,&quot; said Hermione as they scanned the recipe. &quot;Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,&quot; she murmured, running her finger down the list of ingredients. &quot;Well, they&#39;re easy enough, they&#39;re in the student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves... Oooh, look, powdered horn of a bicorn - don&#39;t know where we&#39;re going to get that - shredded skin of a boomslang -. that&#39;ll be tricky, too and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me?&quot; said Ron sharply. &quot;What d&#39;you mean, a bit of whoever we&#39;re changing into? I&#39;m drinking nothing with Crabbe&#39;s toenails in it--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione continued as though she hadn&#39;t heard him.<br /> <br /> &quot;We don&#39;t have to worry about that yet, though, because we add those bits last...&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry.<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you realize how much we&#39;re going to have to steal, Hermione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that&#39;s definitely not in the students&#39;cupboard. What&#39;re we going to do, break into Snape&#39;s private stores? I don&#39;t know if this is a good idea...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione shut the book with a snap.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,&quot; she said. There were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. &quot;I don&#39;t want to break rules, you know. I think threatening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult potion. But if you don&#39;t want to find out if it&#39;s Malfoy, I&#39;ll go straight to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in.<br /> <br /> <br /> &quot;I never thought Id see the day when you&#39;d be persuading us to break rules,&quot; said Ron. &quot;All right, we&#39;ll do it. But not toenails, okay?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How long will it take to make, anyway?&quot; said Harry as Hermione, looking happier, opened the book again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have got to be stewed for twenty-one days... I&#39;d say it&#39;d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A month?&quot; said Ron. &quot;Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school by then!&quot; But Hermione&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, &quot;But it&#39;s the best plan we&#39;ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.&quot;<br /> <br /> However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, &quot;It&#39;ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomorrow.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long, empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.<br /> <br /> As eleven o&#39;clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms. The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood&#39;s usual pre-match pep talk.<br /> <br /> &quot;Slytherin has better brooms than us,&quot; he began. &quot;No point denying it. But we&#39;ve got better people on our brooms. We&#39;ve trained harder than they have, we&#39;ve been flying in all weathers -&quot;(&quot;Too true,&quot; muttered George Weasley. &quot;I haven&#39;t been properly dry since August&quot;)&quot;- and we&#39;re going to make them rue the day they let that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.&quot;<br /> <br /> Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to have something more than a rich father. Get to that Snitch before Malfoy or die trying, Harry, because we&#39;ve got to win today, we&#39;ve got to.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So no pressure, Harry&quot; said Fred, winking at him.<br /> <br /> As they walked out onto the pitch, a roar of noise greeted them; mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the crowd made their boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was necessary.<br /> <br /> &quot;On my whistle,&quot; said Madam Hooch. &quot;Three... two... one...&quot;<br /> <br /> With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting around for the Snitch.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right there, Scarhead?&quot; yelled Malfoy, shooting underneath him as though to show off the speed of his broom.<br /> <br /> Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Close one, Harry!&quot; said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slytherin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in midair and shot straight for Harry again.<br /> <br /> Harry dropped quickly to avoid it, and George managed to hit it hard toward Malfoy. Once again, the Bludger swerved like a boomerang and shot at Harry&#39;s head.<br /> <br /> Harry put on a burst of speed and zoomed toward the other end of the pitch. He could hear the Bludger whistling along behind him. What was going on? Bludgers never concentrated on one player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as possible...<br /> <br /> Fred Weasley was waiting for the Bludger at the other end. Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the Bludger was knocked off course.<br /> <br /> &quot;Gotcha!&quot; Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted to Harry, the Bludger pelted after him once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed.<br /> <br /> It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, splattering onto his glasses. He didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on in the rest of the game until he heard Lee Jordan, who was commentating, say, &quot;Slytherin lead, sixty points to zero.<br /> <br /> <br /> The Slytherins&#39;superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, and meanwhile the mad Bludger was doing all it could to knock Harry out of the air. Fred and George were now flying so close to him on either side that Harry could see nothing at all except their flailing arms and had no chance to look for the Snitch, let alone catch it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Someone&#39;s - tampered - with - this - Bludger -&quot; Fred grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a new attack on Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;We need time out,&quot; said George, trying to signal to Wood and stop the Bludger breaking Harry&#39;s nose at the same time.<br /> <br /> Wood had obviously got the message. Madam Hooch&#39;s whistle rang out and Harry, Fred, and George dived for the ground, still trying to avoid the mad Bludger.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. &quot;We&#39;re being flattened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped Angelina scoring?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We were twenty feet above her, stopping the other Bludger from murdering Harry, Oliver,&quot; said George angrily. &quot;Someone&#39;s fixed it - it won&#39;t leave Harry alone. It hasn&#39;t gone for anyone else all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But the Bludgers have been locked in Madam Hooch&#39;s office since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then...&quot; said Wood, anxiously. Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his direction.<br /> <br /> &quot;Listen,&quot; said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, &quot;with you two flying around me all the time the only way I&#39;m going to catch the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team and let me deal with the rogue one.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be thick,&quot; said Fred. &quot;It&#39;ll take your head off.&quot;<br /> <br /> Wood was looking from Harry to the Weasleys.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oliver, this is insane,&quot; said Alicia Spinner angrily. &quot;You can&#39;t let Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let&#39;s ask for an inquiry...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If we stop now, we&#39;ll have to forfeit the match!&quot; said Harry. &quot;And we&#39;re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This is all your fault,&quot; George said angrily to Wood. &quot;`Get the Snitch or die trying,&#39;what a stupid thing to tell him--&quot;<br /> <br /> Madam Hooch had joined them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready to resume play?&quot; she asked Wood.<br /> <br /> Wood looked at the determined look on Harry&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right,&quot; he said. &quot;Fred, George, you heard Harry - leave him alone and let him deal with the Bludger on his own.&quot;<br /> <br /> The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch&#39;s whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he looped and swooped, spiraled, zigzagged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from the crowd; he knew he must look very stupid, but the rogue Bludger was heavy and couldn&#39;t change direction as quickly as Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the edges of the stadium, squinting through the silver sheets of rain to the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get past Wood.<br /> <br /> A whistling in Harry&#39;s ear told him the Bludger had just missed him again; he turned right over and sped in the opposite direction.<br /> <br /> &quot;Training for the ballet, Potter?&quot; yelled Malfoy as Harry was forced to do a stupid kind of twirl in midair to dodge the Bludger, and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it - the Golden Snitch. It was hovering inches above Malfoy&#39;s left ear - and Malfoy, busy laughing at Harry, hadn&#39;t seen it.<br /> <br /> For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch.<br /> <br /> WHAM.<br /> <br /> He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit him at last, smashed into his elbow, and Harry felt his arm break. Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right arm dangling useless at his side - the Bludger came pelting back for a second attack, this time zooming at his face - Harry swerved out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to Malfoy.<br /> <br /> Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, sneering face below him and saw its eyes widen with fear: Malfoy thought Harry was attacking him.<br /> <br /> &quot;What the -&quot; he gasped, careening out of Harry&#39;s way.<br /> <br /> Harry took his remaining hand off his broom and made a wild snatch; he felt his fingers close on the cold Snitch but was now only gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the crowd below as he headed straight for the ground, trying hard not to pass out.<br /> <br /> With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aha,&quot; he said vaguely. &quot;We&#39;ve won.&quot;<br /> <br /> And he fainted.<br /> <br /> He came around, rain falling on his face, still lying on the field, with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no, not you,&quot; he moaned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s saying,&quot; said Lockhart loudly to the anxious crowd of Gryffindors pressing around them. &quot;Not to worry, Harry. I&#39;m about to fix your arm.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No!&quot; said Harry. &quot;I&#39;ll keep it like this, thanks...&quot;<br /> <br /> He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar clicking noise nearby.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t want a photo of this, Colin,&quot; he said loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lie back, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart soothingly. &quot;It&#39;s a simple charm I&#39;ve used countless times--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Why can&#39;t I just go to the hospital wing?&quot; said Harry through clenched teeth.<br /> <br /> &quot;He should really, Professor,&quot; said a muddy Wood, who couldn&#39;t help grinning even though his Seeker was injured. &quot;Great capture, Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I&#39;d say--&quot;<br /> <br /> Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still putting up a terrific fight.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stand back,&quot; said Lockhart, who was rolling up his jade-green sleeves.<br /> <br /> &quot;No - don&#39;t -&quot; said Harry weakly, but Lockhart was twirling his wand and a second later had directed it straight at Harry&#39;s arm.<br /> <br /> A strange and unpleasant sensation started at Harry&#39;s shoulder and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his arm was being deflated. He didn&#39;t dare look at what was happening. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn&#39;t hurt anymore - nor did it feel remotely like an arm.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah,&quot; said Lockhart. &quot;Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That&#39;s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit.&quot;<br /> <br /> As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.<br /> <br /> Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.<br /> <br /> Lockhart hadn&#39;t mended Harry&#39;s bones. He had removed them.<br /> <br /> Madam Pomfrey wasn&#39;t at all pleased.<br /> <br /> &quot;You should have come straight to me!&quot; she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. &quot;I can mend bones in a second - but growing them back--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You will be able to, won&#39;t you?&quot; said Harry desperately.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,&quot; said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. &quot;You&#39;ll have to stay the night...&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry&#39;s bed while Ron helped him into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve.<br /> <br /> &quot;How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?&quot; Ron called through the curtain as he pulled Harry&#39;s limp fingers through the cuff. &quot;If Harry had wanted deboning he would have asked.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Anyone can make a mistake,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;And it doesn&#39;t hurt anymore, does it, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry, getting into bed. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t do anything else either.&quot;<br /> <br /> As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.<br /> <br /> Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re in for a rough night,&quot; she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it to him. &quot;Regrowing bones is a nasty business.&quot;<br /> <br /> So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry&#39;s mouth and throat as it went down, making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some water. &quot;We won, though,&quot; said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. &quot;That was some catch you made. Malfoy&#39;s face... he looked ready to kill...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,&quot; said Hermione darkly. &quot;We can add that to the list of questions we&#39;ll ask him when we&#39;ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,&quot; said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. &quot;I hope it tastes better than this stuff...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;If it&#39;s got bits of Slytherins in it? You&#39;ve got to be joking,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. &quot;Unbelievable flying, Harry,&quot; said George. &quot;I&#39;ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn&#39;t seem too happy.&quot; They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry&#39;s bed and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, &quot;This boy needs rest, he&#39;s got thirty-three bones to regrow! Out! OUT!&quot; And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the stabbing pains in his limp arm.<br /> <br /> Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in the dark.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get off!&quot; he said loudly, and then, &quot;Dobby!&quot;<br /> <br /> The house-elf&#39;s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter came back to school,&quot; he whispered miserably. &quot;Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn&#39;t you heed Dobby? Why didn&#39;t Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby&#39;s sponge away.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; he said. &quot;And how did you know I missed the train?&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby&#39;s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was you!&quot; he said slowly. &quot;You stopped the barrier from letting us through!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Indeed yes, sir,&quot; said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. &quot;Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward&quot; - he showed Harry ten long, bandaged fingers - &quot;but Dobby didn&#39;t care, sir, for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way!&quot;<br /> <br /> He was rocking backward and forward, shaking his ugly head.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at Hogwarts, he let his master&#39;s dinner burn! Such a flogging Dobby never had, sir...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry slumped back onto his pillows.<br /> <br /> &quot;You nearly got Ron and me expelled,&quot; he said fiercely. &quot;You&#39;d better get lost before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby smiled weakly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home.&quot;<br /> <br /> He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of himself.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why d&#39;you wear that thing, Dobby?&quot; he asked curiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;This, sir?&quot; said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. &quot; Tis a mark of the house-elf&#39;s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his masters present him with clothes, sir. The family is careful not to pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, &quot;Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Your Bludger?&quot; said Harry, anger rising once more. &quot;What d&#39;you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not kill you, sir, never kill you!&quot; said Dobby, shocked. &quot;Dobby wants to save Harry Potter&#39;s life! Better sent home, grievously injured, than remain here sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, is that all?&quot; said Harry angrily. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re going to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!&quot; Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. &quot;If he knew what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course, Dobby is still treated like that, sir,&quot; he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. &quot;But mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord&#39;s power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, sit... And now, at Hogwarts, terrible things are to happen, are perhaps happening already, and Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to repeat itself, now that the Chamber of Secrets is open once more.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry&#39;s water jug from his bedside table and cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, &quot;Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;So there is a Chamber of Secrets?&quot; Harry whispered. &quot;And did you say it&#39;s been opened before? Tell me, Dobby!&quot;<br /> <br /> He seized the elf&#39;s bony wrist as Dobby&#39;s hand inched toward the water jug. &quot;But I&#39;m not Muggle-born - how can I be in danger from the Chamber?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,&quot; stammered the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. &quot;Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this, sir, tis too dangerous--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who is it, Dobby?&quot; Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby&#39;s wrist to stop him from hitting himself with the water jug again. &quot;Who&#39;s opened it? Who opened it last time?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby can&#39;t, sir, Dobby can&#39;t, Dobby mustn&#39;t tell!&quot; squealed the elf. &quot;Go home, Harry Potter, go home!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere!&quot; said Harry fiercely. &quot;One of my best friends is Muggle-born; she&#39;ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!&quot; moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy. &quot;So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not--&quot;<br /> <br /> Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dobby must go!&quot; breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry&#39;s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.<br /> <br /> Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carrying one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it onto a bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get Madam Pomfrey,&quot; whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry&#39;s bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He heard a sharp intake of breath.<br /> <br /> &quot;What happened?&quot; Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue on the bed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Another attack,&quot; said Dumbledore. &quot;Minerva found him on the stairs.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There was a bunch of grapes next to him,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;We think he was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its staring face.<br /> <br /> It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him, holding his camera.<br /> <br /> &quot;Petrified?&quot; whispered Madam Pomfrey.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;But I shudder to think... If Albus hadn&#39;t been on the way downstairs for hot chocolate - who knows what might have--&quot;<br /> <br /> The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin&#39;s rigid grip.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?&quot; said Professor McGonagall eagerly.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore didn&#39;t answer. He opened the back of the camera.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good gracious!&quot; said Madam Pomfrey.<br /> <br /> A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic.<br /> <br /> &quot;Melted,&quot; said Madam Pomfrey wonderingly. &quot;All melted...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What does this mean, Albus?&quot; Professor McGonagall asked urgently.<br /> <br /> &quot;It means,&quot; said Dumbledore, &quot;that the Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again.&quot;<br /> <br /> Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor McGonagall stared at Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> &quot;But, Albus... surely... who?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The question is not who,&quot; said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. &quot;The question is, how...&quot; And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall&#39;s shadowy face, she didn&#39;t understand this any better than he did.</p> "

          "content": "<p> Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin&#39;s bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.<br /> <br /> &quot;All in order,&quot; she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed. &quot;When you&#39;ve finished eating, you may leave.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren&#39;t there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren&#39;t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.<br /> <br /> As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits than last time they&#39;d met.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, hello, Harry,&quot; he said. &quot;Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has just taken the lead for the House Cup - you earned fifty points!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You haven&#39;t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; said Percy, his smile fading. &quot;I hope Ron&#39;s not in another girls&#39;toilet ...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom. He couldn&#39;t see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s me,&quot; he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione&#39;s eye peering through the keyhole.<br /> <br /> `Harry!&quot; she said. &quot;You gave us such a fright - come in. How&#39;s your arm?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Fine,&quot; said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione&#39;s.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;d&#39;ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,&quot; Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. &quot;We&#39;ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.<br /> <br /> &quot;We already know - we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this morning. That&#39;s why we decided we&#39;d better get going--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,&quot; snarled Ron. &quot;D&#39;you know what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s something else,&quot; said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. &quot;Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him - or hadn&#39;t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?&quot; Hermione said.<br /> <br /> &quot;This settles it,&quot; said Ron in a triumphant voice. &quot;Lucius Malfoy must&#39;ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now he&#39;s told dear old Draco how to do it. It&#39;s obvious. Wish Dobby&#39;d told you what kind of monster&#39;s in there, though. I want to know how come nobody&#39;s noticed it sneaking around the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Maybe it can make itself invisible,&quot; said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. &quot;Or maybe it can disguise itself - pretend to be a suit of armor or something - I&#39;ve read about Chameleon Ghouls--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You read too much, Hermione,&quot; said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm.&quot; He shook his head. &quot;You know what, Harry? If he doesn&#39;t stop trying to save your life he&#39;s going to kill you.&quot;<br /> <br /> The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.<br /> <br /> Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure-blood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.<br /> <br /> &quot;They went for Filch first,&quot; Neville said, his round face fearful. &quot;And everyone knows I&#39;m almost a Squib.&quot;<br /> <br /> In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.<br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape&#39;s private stores. Harry privately felt he&#39;d rather face Slytherin&#39;s legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.<br /> <br /> &quot;What we need,&quot; said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon&#39;s double Potions lesson loomed nearer, &quot;is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape&#39;s office and take what we need.&quot; Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I&#39;d better do the actual stealing,&quot; Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. &quot;You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I&#39;ve got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape&#39;s Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.<br /> <br /> Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon&#39;s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors&#39;work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape&#39;s favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say &quot;Unfair.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione&#39;s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry&#39;s eye and nodded.<br /> <br /> Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred&#39;s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle&#39;s cauldron.<br /> <br /> Goyle&#39;s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate - Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had happened. Through the confusion, Harry saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape&#39;s office.<br /> <br /> &quot;Silence! SILENCE!&quot; Snape roared. &quot;Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a Deflating Draft - when I find out who did this--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape&#39;s desk, some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes bulging.<br /> <br /> When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle&#39;s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a sudden hush.<br /> <br /> &quot;If I ever find out who threw this,&quot; Snape whispered, &quot;I shall make sure that person is expelled.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more welcome.<br /> <br /> &quot;He knew it was me,&quot; Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom. &quot;I could tell.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione threw the new ingredients into the cauldron and began to stir feverishly.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;ll be ready in two weeks,&quot; she said happily.<br /> <br /> &quot;Snape can&#39;t prove it was you,&quot; said Ron reassuringly to Harry. &quot;What can he do?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Knowing Snape, something foul,&quot; said Harry as the potion frothed and bubbled.<br /> <br /> A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the entrance hall when they saw a small knot of people gathered around the notice board, reading a piece of parchment that had just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beckoned them over, looking excited.<br /> <br /> &quot;They&#39;re starting a Dueling Club!&quot; said Seamus. &quot;First meeting tonight! I wouldn&#39;t mind dueling lessons; they might come in handy one of these days...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What, you reckon Slytherin&#39;s monster can duel?&quot; said Ron, but he, too, read the sign with interest.<br /> <br /> &quot;Could be useful,&quot; he said to Harry and Hermione as they went into dinner. &quot;Shall we go?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o&#39;clock that evening they hurried back to the Great Hall. The long dining tables had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety black once more and most of the school eemed to be packed beneath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wonder who&#39;ll be teaching us?&quot; said Hermione as they edged into the chattering crowd. &quot;Someone told me Flitwick was a dueling champion when he was young - maybe it&#39;ll be him.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;As long as it&#39;s not -&quot; Harry began, but he ended on a groan: Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black.<br /> <br /> Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called &quot;Gather round, gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent!<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little dueling club, to train you all in case you ever need to defend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions - for full details, see my published works.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,&quot; said Lockhart, flashing a wide smile. &quot;He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration before we begin. Now, I don&#39;t want any of you youngsters to worry - you&#39;ll still have your Potions master when I&#39;m through with him, never fear!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be good if they finished each other off?&quot; Ron muttered in Harry&#39;s ear.<br /> <br /> Snape&#39;s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he&#39;d have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction.<br /> <br /> Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at least, Lockhart did, with much twirling of his hands, whereas Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like swords in front of them.<br /> <br /> &quot;As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position,&quot; Lockhart told the silent crowd. &quot;On the count of three, we will cast our first spells. Neither of us will be aiming to kill, of course.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I wouldn&#39;t bet on that,&quot; Harry murmured, watching Snape baring his teeth.<br /> <br /> &quot;One - two - three--&quot;<br /> <br /> Both of them swung their wands above their heads and pointed them at their opponent; Snape cried: &quot;Expelliarmus!&quot; There was a dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid down it to sprawl on the floor.<br /> <br /> Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was dancing on tiptoes. &quot;Do you think he&#39;s all right?&quot; she squealed through her fingers.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who cares?&quot; said Harry and Ron together.<br /> <br /> Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off and his wavy hair was standing on end.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, there you have it!&quot; he said, tottering back onto the platform. &quot;That was a Disarming Charm - as you see, I&#39;ve lost my wand - ah, thank you, Miss Brown - yes, an excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don&#39;t mind my saying so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however, I felt it would be instructive to let them see...&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, because he said, &quot;Enough demonstrating! I&#39;m going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you&#39;d like to help me--&quot;<br /> <br /> They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lockhart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached Harry and Ron first.<br /> <br /> &quot;Time to split up the dream team, I think,&quot; he sneered. &quot;Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry moved automatically toward Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; said Snape, smiling coldly. &quot;Mr. Malfoy, come over here. Let&#39;s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin girl who reminded Harry of a picture he&#39;d seen in Holidays with Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggressively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return.<br /> <br /> &quot;Face your partners!&quot; called Lockhart, back on the platform. &quot;And bow!&quot;<br /> <br /> Hrry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their eyes off each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wands at the ready!&quot; shouted Lockhart. &quot;When I count to three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we don&#39;t want any accidents - one ... two ... three--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on &quot;two&quot;: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he&#39;d been hit over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still seemed to be working, and wasting no more time, Harry pointed his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, &quot; Rictusempra! &quot;<br /> <br /> A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled up, wheezing.<br /> <br /> &quot;I said disarm only!&quot; Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laughing. Harry hung back, with a vague feeling it would be unsporting to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mistake; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry&#39;s knees, choked, &quot; Tarantallegra!&quot; and the next second Harry&#39;s legs began to jerk around out of his control in a kind of quickstep.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stop! Stop!&quot; screamed Lockhart, but Snape took charge. &quot;Finite Incantatem!&quot; he shouted; Harry&#39;s feet stopped dancing, Malfoy stopped laughing, and they were able to look up.<br /> <br /> A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was holding up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. Harry leapt forward and pulled Millicent off. It was difficult: She was a lot bigger than he was.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dear, dear,&quot; said Lockhart, skittering through the crowd, looking at the aftermath of the duels. &quot;Up you go, Macmillan...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Careful there, Miss Fawcett... Pinch it hard, it&#39;ll stop bleeding in a second,&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I think I&#39;d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,&quot; said Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. &quot;Let&#39;s have a volunteer pair - Longbottom and Finch-Fletchley, how about you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,&quot; said Snape, gliding over like a large and malevolent bat. &quot;Longbottom causes devastation with the simplest spells. We&#39;ll be sending what&#39;s left of Finch-Fletchley up to the hospital wing in a matchbox.&quot; Neville&#39;s round, pink face went pinker. &quot;How about Malfoy and Potter?&quot; said Snape with a twisted smile.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excellent idea!&quot; said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them room.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, Harry,&quot; said Lockhart. &quot;When Draco points his wand at you, you do this.&quot;<br /> <br /> He raised his own wand, attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action, and dropped it. Snape smirked as Lockhart quickly picked it up, saying, &quot;Whoops - my wand is a little overexcited--&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered something in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at Lockhart and said, &quot;Professor, could you show me that blocking thing again?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Scared?&quot; muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn&#39;t hear him.<br /> <br /> &quot;You wish,&quot; said Harry out of the corner of his mouth.<br /> <br /> Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. &quot;Just do what I did, Harry!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What, drop my wand?&quot;<br /> <br /> But Lockhart wasn&#39;t listening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Three - two - one - go!&quot; he shouted.<br /> <br /> Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, &quot; Serpensortia!&quot;<br /><br /> The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd backed swiftly away, clearing the floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t move, Potter,&quot; said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. &quot;I&#39;ll get rid of it...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Allow me!&quot; shouted Lockhart. He brandished his wand at the snake and there was a loud bang; the snake, instead of vanishing, flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud smack. Enraged, hissing furiously, it slithered straight toward Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised itself again, fangs exposed, poised to strike.<br /> <br /> Harry wasn&#39;t sure what made him do it. He wasn&#39;t even aware of deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him forward as though he was on casters and that he had shouted stupidly at the snake, &quot;Leave him alone!&quot; And miraculously - inexplicably - the snake slumped to the floor, docile as a thick, black garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of him. He knew the snake wouldn&#39;t attack anyone now, though how he knew it, he couldn&#39;t have explained.<br /> <br /> He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful - but certainly not angry and scared.<br /> <br /> &quot;What do you think you&#39;re playing at?&quot; he shouted, and before Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall.<br /> <br /> Snape stepped forward, waved his wand, and the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke. Snape, too, was looking at Harry in an unexpected way: It was a shrewd and calculating look, and Harry didn&#39;t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all around the walls. Then he felt a tugging on the back of his robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on,&quot; said Ron&#39;s voice in his ear. &quot;Move - come on--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron steered him out of the hall, Hermione hurrying alongside them. As they went through the doors, the people on either side drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. Harry didn&#39;t have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor Hermione explained anything until they had dragged him all the way up to the empty Gryffindor common room.<br /> <br /> Then Ron pushed Harry into an armchair and said, &quot;You&#39;re a Parselmouth. Why didn&#39;t you tell us?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m a what?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> `A Parselmouth!&quot; said Ron. &quot;You can talk to snakes!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I know,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I mean, that&#39;s only the second time I&#39;ve ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once - long story - but it was telling me it had never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to that was before I knew I was a wizard--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?&quot; Ron repeated faintly.<br /> <br /> &quot;So?&quot; said Harry. &quot;I bet loads of people here can do it.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no they can&#39;t,&quot; said Ron. &quot;It&#39;s not a very common gift. Harry, this is bad.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s bad?&quot; said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with everyone? Listen, if I hadn&#39;t told that snake not to attack Justin--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, that&#39;s what you said to it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What d&#39;you mean? You were there - you heard me--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I heard you speaking Parseltongue,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Snake language. You could have been saying anything - no wonder Justin panicked, you sounded like you were egging the snake on or something - it was creepy, you know--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry gaped at him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I spoke a different language? But - I didn&#39;t realize - how can I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as though someone had died. Harry couldn&#39;t see what was so terrible.<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you want to tell me what&#39;s wrong with stopping a massive snake biting off Justin&#39;s head?&quot; he said. &quot;What does it matter how I did it as long as Justin doesn&#39;t have to join the Headless Hunt?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It matters,&quot; said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, &quot;because being able to talk to snakes was what Salazar Slytherin was famous for. That&#39;s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s mouth fell open.<br /> <br /> &quot;Exactly,&quot; said Ron. &quot;And now the whole school&#39;s going to think you&#39;re his great-great-great-great-grandson or something--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But I&#39;m not,&quot; said Harry, with a panic he couldn&#39;t quite explain.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ll find that hard to prove,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;He lived about a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry lay awake for hours that night. Through a gap in the curtains around his four-poster he watched snow starting to drift past the tower window and wondered...<br /> <br /> Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slithering? He didn&#39;t know anything about his father&#39;s family, after all. The Dursleys had always forbidden questions about his wizarding relatives.<br /> <br /> Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The words wouldn&#39;t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a snake to do it.<br /> <br /> But I&#39;m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn&#39;t have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood...<br /> <br /> Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don&#39;t you remember?<br /> <br /> Harry turned over. He&#39;d see Justin the next day in Herbology and he&#39;d explain that he&#39;d been calling the snake off, not egging it on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool should have realized.<br /> <br /> By next morning, however, the snow that had begun in the night had turned into a blizzard so thick that the last Herbology lesson of the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and scarves on the Mandrakes, a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey.<br /> <br /> Harry fretted about this next to the fire in the Gryffindor common room, while Ron and Hermione used their time off to play a game of wizard chess.<br /> <br /> &quot;For heaven&#39;s sake, Harry,&quot; said Hermione, exasperated, as one of Ron&#39;s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him off the board. &quot;Go and find Justin if it&#39;s so important to you.&quot;<br /> <br /> So Harry got up and left through the portrait hole, wondering where Justin might be.<br /> <br /> The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first.<br /> <br /> A group of the Hufliepuffs who should have been in Herbology were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn&#39;t seem to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry could see that their heads were close together and they were having what looked like an absorbing conversation. He couldn&#39;t see whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section.<br /> <br /> &quot;So anyway,&quot; a stout boy was saying, &quot;I told Justin to hide up in our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter&#39;s marked him down as his next victim, it&#39;s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, Justin&#39;s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. Justin actually told him he&#39;d been down for Eton. That&#39;s not the kind of thing you bandy about with Slytherin&#39;s heir on the loose, is it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?&quot; said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hannah,&quot; said the stout boy solemnly, &quot;he&#39;s a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that&#39;s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.&quot;<br /> <br /> There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, &quot;Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Flich&#39;s cat&#39;s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying in the mud. Next thing we know - Creevey&#39;s been attacked.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He always seems so nice, though,&quot; said Hannah uncertainly, &quot;and, well, he&#39;s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He can&#39;t be all bad, can he?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ernie lowered his voice mysteriously, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie&#39;s words.<br /> <br /> &quot;No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. I mean to say, he was only a baby when it happened. He should have been blasted into smithereens. Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that.&quot; He dropped his voice until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, &quot;That&#39;s probably why You- Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn&#39;t want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other powers Potter&#39;s been hiding?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t take anymore. Clearing his throat loudly, he stepped out from behind the bookshelves. If he hadn&#39;t been feeling so angry, he would have found the sight that greeted him funny: Every one of the Hufflepuffs looked as though they had been Petrified by the sight of him, and the color was draining out of Ernie&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I&#39;m looking for Justin Finch-Fletchley.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Hufflepuffs&#39;worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They all looked fearfully at Ernie.<br /> <br /> &quot;What do you want with him?&quot; said Ernie in a quavering voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wanted to tell him what really happened with that snake at the Dueling Club,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, &quot;We were all there. We saw what happened.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed off?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;All I saw,&quot; said Ernie stubbornly, though he was trembling as he spoke, &quot;was you speaking Parseltongue and chasing the snake toward Justin.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I didn&#39;t chase it at him!&quot; Harry said, his voice shaking with anger. &quot;It didn&#39;t even touch him!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It was a very near miss,&quot; said Ernie. &quot;And in case you&#39;re getting ideas,&quot; he added hastily, &quot;I might tell you that you can trace my family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and my blood&#39;s as pure as anyone&#39;s, so--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;- I don&#39;t care what sort of blood you&#39;ve got!&quot; said Harry fiercely. &quot;Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,&quot; said Ernie swiftly.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I&#39;d like to see you try it.&quot;<br /> <br /> He turned on his heel and stormed out of the library, earning himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing the gilded cover of a large spellbook.<br /> <br /> Harry blundered up the corridor, barely noticing where he was going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto the floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, hello, Hagrid,&quot; Harry said, looking up.<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s face was entirely hidden by a woolly, snow-covered balaclava, but it couldn&#39;t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands.<br /> <br /> &quot;All righ&#39;, Harry?&quot; he said, pulling up the balaclava so he could speak. &quot;Why aren&#39;t yeh in class?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Canceled,&quot; said Harry, getting up. &quot;What&#39;re you doing in here?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid held up the limp rooster.<br /> <br /> &quot;Second one killed this term,&quot; he explained. &quot;It&#39;s either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear, an&#39;I need the Headmaster&#39;s permission ter put a charm around the hen coop.&quot;<br /> <br /> He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snowflecked eyebrows.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh sure yeh&#39;re all righ&#39;? Yeh look all hot an&#39;bothered--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;Id better get going, Hagrid, it&#39;s Transfiguration next and I&#39;ve got to pick up my books.&quot;<br /> <br /> He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Justin&#39;s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over something lying on the floor.<br /> <br /> He turned to squint at what he&#39;d fallen over and felt as though his stomach had dissolved.<br /> <br /> Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn&#39;t all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.<br /> <br /> It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin&#39;s.<br /> <br /> Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He lookedwildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side.<br /> <br /> He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn&#39;t just leave them lying here... He had to get help... Would anyone believe he hadn&#39;t had anything to do with this?<br /> <br /> As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the Poltergeist came shooting out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Why, it&#39;s potty wee Potter!&quot; cackled Peeves, knocking Harry&#39;s glasses askew as he bounced past him. &quot;What&#39;s Potter up to? Why&#39;s Potter lurking--&quot;<br /> <br /> Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, &quot;ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!&quot;<br /> <br /> Crash - crash - crash - door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.<br /> <br /> &quot;Caught in the act!&quot; Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically at Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;That will do, Macmillan!&quot; said Professor McGonagall sharply.<br /> <br /> Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke into song:<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You&#39;re killing off&#39;students, you think it&#39;s good fun--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s enough Peeves!&quot; barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away backward, with his tongue out at Harry.<br /> <br /> Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.<br /> <br /> &quot;This way, Potter,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor,&quot; said Harry at once, &quot;I swear I didn&#39;t--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;This is out of my hands, Potter,&quot; said Professor McGonagall curtly.<br /> <br /> They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lemon drop!&quot; she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn&#39;t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.<br /> <br /> He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived.</p> "

          "title": "The Polyjuice Potion",
          "content": "<p> They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him there, alone.<br /> <br /> Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers&#39;offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore&#39;s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn&#39;t been scared out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very pleased to have a chance to look around it.<br /> <br /> It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard&#39;s hat - the Sorting Hat.<br /> <br /> Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn&#39;t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see... just to make sure it had put him in the right House.<br /> <br /> He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he&#39;d put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a small voice said in his ear, &quot;Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Er, yes,&quot; Harry muttered. &quot;Er - sorry to bother you - I wanted to ask--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,&quot; said the hat smartly. &quot;Yes... you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before -&quot; Harry&#39;s heart leapt - &quot;you would have done well in Slytherin--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn&#39;t move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.<br /> <br /> He wasn&#39;t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.<br /> <br /> Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore&#39;s pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.<br /> <br /> Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn&#39;t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a smouldering pile of ash on the floor.<br /> <br /> The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.<br /> <br /> &quot;Professor,&quot; Harry gasped. &quot;Your bird - I couldn&#39;t do anything - he just caught fire--&quot;<br /> <br /> To Harry&#39;s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.<br /> <br /> &quot;About time, too,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s been looking dreadful for days; I&#39;ve been telling him to get a move on.&quot;<br /> <br /> He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry&#39;s face.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,&quot; said Dumbledore, seating himself behind his desk. &quot;He&#39;s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.&quot;<br /> <br /> In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.<br /> <br /> Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;It wasn&#39;Harry, Professor Dumbledore!&quot; said Hagrid urgently. &quot;I was talkin&#39;ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.<br /> <br /> &quot;it can&#39;t&#39;ve bin him, I&#39;ll swear it in front o&#39;the Ministry o&#39;Magic if I have to.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid, I--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;- yeh&#39;ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid!&quot; said Dumbledore loudly. &quot;I do not think that Harry attacked those people.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. &quot;Right. I&#39;ll wait outside then, Headmaster.&quot;<br /> <br /> And he stomped out looking embarrassed.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t think it was me, Professor?&quot; Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore brushed rooster feathers off his desk.<br /> <br /> &quot;No, Harry, I don&#39;t,&quot; said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. &quot;But I still want to talk to you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers together.<br /> <br /> &quot;I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you&#39;d like to tell me,&quot; he said gently. &quot;Anything at all.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, &quot;You&#39;ll be next, Mudbloods!&quot; and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron had said: &quot;Hearing voices no one else can hear isn&#39;t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.&quot; He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin...<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry. &quot;There isn&#39;t anything, Professor...&quot;<br /> <br /> The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick&#39;s fate that seemed to worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other; what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for Christmas.<br /> <br /> &quot;At this rate, we&#39;ll be the only ones left,&quot; Ron told Harry and Hermione. &quot;Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it&#39;s going to be.&quot;<br /> <br /> Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.<br /> <br /> Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, &quot;Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wizard coming through...&quot;<br /> <br /> Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.<br /> <br /> &quot;It is not a laughing matter,&quot; he said coldly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, get out of the way, Percy,&quot; said Fred. &quot;Harry&#39;s in a hurry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, he&#39;s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,&quot; said George, chortling.<br /> <br /> Ginny didn&#39;t find it amusing either.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, don&#39;t,&quot; she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met.<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin&#39;s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s because he&#39;s bursting to say it&#39;s really him,&quot; said Ron knowingly. &quot;You know how he hates anyone beating him at anything, and you&#39;re getting all the credit for his dirty work.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not for long,&quot; said Hermione in a satisfied tone. &quot;The Polyjuice Potion&#39;s nearly ready. We&#39;ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.&quot;<br /> <br /> At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he, Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private. Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, didn&#39;t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.<br /> <br /> Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying presents for them both.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wake up,&quot; she said loudly, pulling back the curtains at the window.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione - you&#39;re not supposed to be in here -&quot; said Ron, shielding his eyes against the light.<br /> <br /> &quot;Merry Christmas to you, too,&quot; said Hermione, throwing him his present. &quot;I&#39;ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It&#39;s ready.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Positive,&quot; said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the end of Ron&#39;s four-poster. &quot;If we&#39;re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.&quot;<br /> <br /> At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her beak.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello,&quot; said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. &quot;Are you speaking to me again?&quot;<br /> <br /> She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he&#39;d be able to stay at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.<br /> <br /> The rest of Harry&#39;s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs. Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley&#39;s car (which hadn&#39;t been seen since its crash with the Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.<br /> <br /> No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts.<br /> <br /> The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he consumed. Percy, who hadn&#39;t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read &quot;Pinhead,&quot; kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn&#39;t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remark about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a few hours&#39;time.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.<br /> <br /> &quot;We still need a bit of the people you&#39;re changing into,&quot; said Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. &quot;And obviously, it&#39;ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe&#39;s and Goyle&#39;s; they&#39;re Malfoys best friends, he&#39;ll tell them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can&#39;t burst in on us while we&#39;re interrogating him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve got it all worked out,&quot; she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry&#39;s and Ron&#39;s stupefied faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. &quot;I&#39;ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how greedy they are, they&#39;re bound to eat them. Once they&#39;re asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, I don&#39;t think--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That could go seriously wrong--&quot;<br /> <br /> But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall sometimes had.<br /> <br /> &quot;The potion will be useless without Crabbe&#39;s and Goyle&#39;s hair,&quot; she said sternly. &quot;You do want to investigate Malfoy, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, all right, all right,&quot; said Harry. &quot;But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping out?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve already got mine!&quot; said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket and showing them the single hair inside it. &quot;Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! And she&#39;s gone home for Christmas - so I&#39;ll just have to tell the Slytherins I&#39;ve decided to come back.&quot;<br /> <br /> When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to Harry with a doom-laden expression.<br /> <br /> &quot;Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?&quot;<br /> <br /> But to Harry&#39;s and Ron&#39;s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea, waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.<br /> <br /> &quot;How thick can you get?&quot; Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor.<br /> <br /> By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that covered Goyle&#39;s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe&#39;s hairs. They also stole their shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe- and Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom.<br /> <br /> They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione?&quot;<br /> <br /> They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.<br /> <br /> &quot;Did you get them?&quot; Hermione asked breathlessly.<br /> <br /> Harry showed her Goyle&#39;s hair.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,&quot; Hermione said, holding up a small sack. &quot;You&#39;ll need bigger sizes once you&#39;re Crabbe and Goyle.&quot;<br /> <br /> The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve done everything right,&quot; said Hermione, nervously rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. &quot;It looks like the book says it should... once we&#39;ve drunk it, we&#39;ll have exactly an hour before we change back into ourselves.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what?&quot; Ron whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode&#39;s hair out of its bottle into the first glass.<br /> <br /> The potion hissed loudly like a boiling kettle and frothed madly. A second later, it had turned a sick sort of yellow.<br /> <br /> &quot;Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode,&quot; said Ron, eyeing it with loathing. &quot;Bet it tastes disgusting.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Add yours, then,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> Harry dropped Goyle&#39;s hair into the middle glass and Ron put Crabbe&#39;s into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle&#39;s turned the khaki color of a booger, Crabbe&#39;s a dark, murky brown.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hang on,&quot; said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their glasses. &quot;We&#39;d better not all drink them in here... Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won&#39;t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode&#39;s no pixie.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Good thinking,&quot; said Ron, unlocking the door. &quot;We&#39;ll take separate stalls.&quot;<br /> <br /> Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped into the middle stall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready?&quot; he called.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ready,&quot; came Ron&#39;s and Hermione&#39;s voices.<br /> <br /> &quot;One - two - three--&quot;<br /> <br /> Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage.<br /> <br /> Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he&#39;d just swallowed live snakes - doubled up, he wondered whether he was going to be sick - then a burning sensation spread rapidly from his stomach to the very ends of his fingers and toes - next, bringing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax - and before his eyes, his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, the knuckles were bulging like bolts - his shoulders stretched painfully and a prickling on his forehead told him that hair was creeping down toward his eyebrows - his robes ripped as his chest expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops - his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small.<br /> <br /> As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay facedown on the stone-cold floor, listening to Myrtle gurgling morosely in the end toilet. With difficulty, he kicked off his shoes and stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle&#39;s boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because Goyle obviously didn&#39;t need them - he took them off and called, &quot;Are you two okay?&quot; Goyle&#39;s low rasp of a voice issued from his mouth.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah,&quot; came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right.<br /> <br /> Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked mirror. Goyle stared back at him out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry scratched his ear. So did Goyle.<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he looked pale and shocked, Ron was indistinguishable from Crabbe, from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms.<br /> <br /> &quot;This is unbelievable,&quot; said Ron, approaching the mirror and prodding Crabbe&#39;s flat nose. &quot;Unbelievable.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;d better get going,&quot; said Harry, loosening the watch that was cutting into Goyle&#39;s thick wrist. &quot;We&#39;ve still got to find out where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find someone to follow...&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron, who had been gazing at Harry, said, &quot;You don&#39;t know how bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking.&quot; He banged on Hermione&#39;s door. &quot;C&#39;mon, we need to go--&quot;<br /> <br /> A high-pitched voice answered him.<br /> <br /> &quot;I - I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to come after all. You go on without me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode&#39;s ugly, no one&#39;s going to know it&#39;s you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No - really - I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll come. You two hurry up, you&#39;re wasting time--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked at Ron, bewildered.<br /> <br /> &quot;That looks more like Goyle,&quot; said Ron. &quot;That&#39;s how he looks every time a teacher asks him a question.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, are you okay?&quot; said Harry through the door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Fine - I&#39;m fine - go on--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes had already passed.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll meet you back here, all right?&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, checked that the coast was clear, and set off.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t swing your arms like that,&quot; Harry muttered to Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Eh?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Crabbe holds them sort of stiff...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s better...&quot;<br /> <br /> They went down the marble staircase. All they needed now was a Slytherin that they could follow to the Slytherin common room, but there was nobody around.<br /> <br /> &quot;Any ideas?&quot; muttered Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,&quot; said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curly hair emerged from the entrance.<br /> <br /> &quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Ron, hurrying up to her. &quot;We&#39;ve forgotten the way to our common room.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; said the girl stiffly. &quot;Our common room? I&#39;m a Ravenclaw.&quot;<br /> <br /> She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron hurried down the stone steps into the darkness, their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe&#39;s and Goyle&#39;s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn&#39;t going to be as easy as they had hoped.<br /> <br /> The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper and deeper under the school, constantly checking their watches to see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just when they were getting desperate, they heard a sudden movement ahead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ha!&quot; said Ron excitedly. &quot;There&#39;s one of them now!&quot;<br /> <br /> The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn&#39;t a Slytherin, it was Percy.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;re you doing down here?&quot; said Ron in surprise.<br /> <br /> Percy looked affronted.<br /> <br /> &quot;That,&quot; he said stiffly, &quot;is none of your business. It&#39;s Crabbe, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Wh - oh, yeah,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, get off to your dormitories,&quot; said Percy sternly. &quot;It&#39;s not safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You are,&quot; Ron pointed out.<br /> <br /> &quot;I,&quot; said Percy, drawing himself up, &quot;am a prefect. Nothing&#39;s about to attack me.&quot;<br /> <br /> A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry was pleased to see him.<br /> <br /> &quot;There you are,&quot; he drawled, looking at them. &quot;Have you two been pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? I&#39;ve been looking for you; I want to show you something really funny.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy glanced witheringly at Percy.<br /> <br /> &quot;And what&#39;re you doing down here, Weasley?&quot; he sneered.<br /> <br /> Percy looked outraged.<br /> <br /> &quot;You want to show a bit more respect to a school prefect!&quot; he said. &quot;I don&#39;t like your attitude!&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy sneered and motioned for Harry and Ron to follow him. Harry almost said something apologetic to Percy but caught himself just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they turned into the next passage, &quot;That Peter Weasley--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Percy,&quot; Ron corrected him automatically.<br /> <br /> &quot;Whatever,&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed him sneaking around a lot lately. And I bet I know what he&#39;s up to. He thinks he&#39;s going to catch Slytherin&#39;s heir single-handed.&quot;<br /> <br /> He gave a short, derisive laugh. Harry and Ron exchanged excited looks.<br /> <br /> Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the new password again?&quot; he said to Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Er -&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah - pure-blood!&quot; said Malfoy, not listening, and a stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched through it, and Harry and Ron followed him.<br /> <br /> The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, greenish lamps were hanging on chains. A fire was crackling under an elaborately carved mantelpiece ahead of them, and several Slytherins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wait here,&quot; said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to a pair of empty chairs set back from the fire. &quot;I&#39;ll go and get it my father&#39;s just sent it to me--&quot;<br /> <br /> Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home.<br /> <br /> Malfoy came back a minute later, holding what looked like a newspaper clipping. He thrust it under Ron&#39;s nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;ll give you a laugh,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Harry saw Ron&#39;s eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping quickly, gave a very forced laugh, and handed it to Harry.<br /> <br /> It had been clipped out of the Daily Prophet , and it said:<br /> <br /> INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC<br /> <br /> Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, was today fined fifty Galleons for bewitching a Muggle car.<br /> <br /> Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a governor of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the enchanted car crashed earlier this year, called today for Mr. Weasley&#39;s resignation. &quot;Weasley has brought the Ministry into disrepute,&quot; Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. &quot;He is clearly unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Muggle Protection Act should be scrapped immediately.&quot;<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, although his wife told reporters to clear off or she&#39;d set the family ghoul on them.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well?&quot; said Malfoy impatiently as Harry handed the clipping back to him. &quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s funny?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ha, ha,&quot; said Harry bleakly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his wand in half and go and join them,&quot; said Malfoy scornfully. &quot;You&#39;d never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s - or rather, Crabbe&#39;s - face was contorted with fury.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up with you, Crabbe?&quot; snapped Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stomachache,&quot; Ron grunted.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods a kick from me,&quot; said Malfoy, snickering. &quot;You know, I&#39;m surprised the Daily Prophet hasn&#39;t reported all these attacks yet,&quot; he went on thoughtfully. &quot;I suppose Dumbledore&#39;s trying to hush it all up. He&#39;ll be sacked if it doesn&#39;t stop soon. Father&#39;s always said old Dumbledore&#39;s the worst thing that&#39;s ever happened to this place. He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never&#39;ve let slime like that Creevey in.&quot;<br /> <br /> Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: &quot;`Potter, can I have your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?&quot;<br /> <br /> He dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter with you two?&quot;<br /> <br /> Far too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.<br /> <br /> &quot;Saint Potter, the Mudbloods&#39;friend,&quot; said Malfoy slowly. &quot;He&#39;s another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn&#39;t go around with that jumped up Granger Mudblood. And people think he&#39;s Slytherin&#39;s heir!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away from telling them it was him - but then &quot;I wish I knew who it is,&quot; said Malfoy petulantly. &quot;I could help them.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron&#39;s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy didn&#39;t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, &quot;You must have some idea who&#39;s behind it all...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You know I haven&#39;t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?&quot; snapped Malfoy. &quot;And Father won&#39;t tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before his time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and it&#39;ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it&#39;s a matter of time before one of them&#39;s killed this time... I hope it&#39;s Granger,&quot; he said with relish.<br /> <br /> Ron was clenching Crabbe&#39;s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said, &quot;D&#39;you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah... whoever it was was expelled,&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;They&#39;re probably still in Azkaban.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Azkaban?&quot; said Harry, puzzled.<br /> <br /> &quot;Azkaban - the wizard prison, Goyle,&quot; said Malfoy, looking at him in disbelief &quot;Honestly, if you were any slower, you&#39;d be going backward.&quot;<br /> <br /> He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, &quot;Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get mixed up in it. Of course, he&#39;s got a lot on his plate at the moment. You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tried to force Goyle&#39;s dull face into a look of concern.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah...&quot; said Malfoy. &quot;Luckily, they didn&#39;t find much. Father&#39;s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we&#39;ve got our own secret chamber under the drawing-room floor--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Ho!&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> Malfoy looked at him. So did Harry. Ron blushed. Even his hair was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening - their hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look of horror he was suddenly giving Harry, he must be, too.<br /> <br /> They both jumped to their feet.<br /> <br /> &quot;Medicine for my stomach,&quot; Ron grunted, and without further ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn&#39;t noticed anything. Harry could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle&#39;s huge shoes and had to hoist up his robes as he shrank; they crashed up the steps into the dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming from the closet where they&#39;d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t a complete waste of time,&quot; Ron panted, closing the bathroom door behind them. &quot;I know we still haven&#39;t found out who&#39;s doing the attacks, but I&#39;m going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys&#39;drawing room.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry checked his face in the cracked mirror. He was back to normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of Hermione&#39;s stall.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione, come out, we&#39;ve got loads to tell you--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Go away!&quot; Hermione squeaked.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron looked at each other.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; said Ron. &quot;You must be back to normal by now, we are.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Moaning Myrtle glided suddenly through the stall door. Harry had never seen her looking so happy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ooooooh, wait till you see,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s awful--&quot;<br /> <br /> They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sobbing, her robes pulled up over her head.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; said Ron uncertainly. &quot;Have you still got Millicent&#39;s nose or something?&quot;<br /> <br /> Hermione let her robes fall and Ron backed into the sink.<br /> <br /> Her face was covered in black fur. Her eyes had turned yellow and there were long, pointed ears poking through her hair.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was a c-cat hair!&quot; she howled. &quot;M-Millicent Bulstrode m-must have a cat! And the p-potion isn&#39;t supposed to be used for animal transformations!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;ll be teased something dreadful,&quot; said Myrtle happily.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s okay, Hermione,&quot; said Harry quickly. &quot;We&#39;ll take you up to the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many questions...&quot;<br /> <br /> It took a long time to persuade Hermione to leave the bathroom. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guffaw. &quot;Wait till everyone finds out you&#39;ve got a tail!&quot;</p> "

          "title": "The Very Secret Diary",
          "content": "<p> Hermione remained in the hospital wing for several weeks. There was a flurry of rumor about her disappearance when the rest of the school arrived back from their Christmas holidays, because of course everyone thought that she had been attacked. So many students filed past the hospital wing trying to catch a glimpse of her that Madam Pomfrey took out her curtains again and placed them around Hermione&#39;s bed, to spare her the shame of being seen with a furry face.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron went to visit her every evening. When the new term started, they brought her each day&#39;s homework.<br /> <br /> &quot;If I&#39;d sprouted whiskers, I&#39;d take a break from work,&quot; said Ron, tipping a stack of books onto Hermione&#39;s bedside table one evening.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Ron, I&#39;ve got to keep up,&quot; said Hermione briskly. Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;ve got any new leads?&quot; she added in a whisper, so that Madam Pomfrey couldn&#39;t hear her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothing,&quot; said Harry gloomily.<br /> <br /> &quot;I was so sure it was Malfoy,&quot; said Ron, for about the hundredth time.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; asked Harry, pointing to something gold sticking out from under Hermione&#39;s pillow.<br /> <br /> &quot;Just a get well card,&quot; said Hermione hastily, trying to poke it out of sight, but Ron was too quick for her. He pulled it out, flicked it open, and read aloud:<br /> <br /> &quot;To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your concerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly&#39;s Most Charming Smile Award.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted.<br /> <br /> &quot;You sleep with this under your pillow?&quot;<br /> <br /> But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweeping over with her evening dose of medicine.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you&#39;ve ever met, or what?&quot; Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the stairs toward Gryffindor Tower.<br /> <br /> Snape had given them so much homework, Harry thought he was likely to be in the sixth year before he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked Hermione how many rat tails you were supposed to add to a Hair Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above reached their ears.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s Filch,&quot; Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and paused, out of sight, listening hard.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t think someone else&#39;s been attacked?&quot; said Ron tensely.<br /> <br /> They stood still, their heads inclined toward Flich&#39;s voice, which sounded quite hysterical.<br /> <br /> &quot;even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven&#39;t got enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I&#39;m going to Dumbledore--&quot;<br /> <br /> His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they heard a distant door slam.<br /> <br /> They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly been manning his usual lookout post: They were once again on the spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They saw at a glance what Filch had been shouting about. A great flood of water stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle&#39;s bathroom. Now that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle&#39;s wails echoing off the bathroom walls.<br /> <br /> &quot;Now what&#39;s up with her?&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let&#39;s go and see,&quot; said Harry, and holding their robes over their ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door bearing its OUT OF ORDER sign, ignored it as always, and entered.<br /> <br /> Moaning Myrtle was crying, if possible, louder and harder than ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up, Myrtle?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Who&#39;s that?&quot; glugged Myrtle miserably. &quot;Come to throw something else at me?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry waded across to her stall and said, &quot;Why would I throw something at you?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t ask me,&quot; Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. &quot;Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it&#39;s funny to throw a book at me...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But it can&#39;t hurt you if someone throws something at you,&quot; said Harry, reasonably. &quot;I mean, it&#39;d just go right through you, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;<br /> <br /> He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and shrieked, &quot;Let&#39;s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can&#39;t feel it! Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don&#39;t think!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Who threw it at you, anyway?&quot; asked Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t know... I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death, and it fell right through the top of my head,&quot; said Myrtle, glaring at them. &quot;It&#39;s over there, it got washed out...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was pointing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped forward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold him back.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; said Ron. &quot;It could be dangerous.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Dangerous?&quot;said Harry, laughing. &quot;Come off it, how could it be dangerous?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d be surprised,&quot; said Ron, who was looking apprehensively at the book. &quot;Some of the books the Ministry&#39;s confiscated Dad&#39;s told me - there was one that burned your eyes out. And everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed. And--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, I&#39;ve got the point,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> The little book lay on the floor, nondescript and soggy.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, we won&#39;t find out unless we look at it,&quot; he said, and he ducked around Ron and picked it up off the floor.<br /> <br /> Harry saw at once that it was a diary, and the faded year on the cover told him it was fifty years old. He opened it eagerly. On the first page he could just make out the name &quot;T M. Riddle&quot; in smudged ink.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hang on,&quot; said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was looking over Harry&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I know that name... T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How on earth d&#39;you know that?&quot; said Harry in amazement.<br /> <br /> &quot;Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,&quot; said Ron resentfully. &quot;That was the one I burped slugs all over. If you&#39;d wiped slime off a name for an hour, you&#39;d remember it, too.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were completely blank. There wasn&#39;t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even Auntie Mabel&#39;s birthday, or dentist, half-past three.<br /> <br /> &quot;He never wrote in it,&quot; said Harry, disappointed.<br /> <br /> &quot;I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?&quot; said Ron curiously.<br /> <br /> Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London.<br /> <br /> &quot;He must&#39;ve been Muggle-born,&quot; said Harry thoughtfully. &quot;To have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, it&#39;s not much use to you,&quot; said Ron. He dropped his voice. &quot;Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle&#39;s nose.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, however, pocketed it.<br /> <br /> Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and furfree, at the beginning of February. On her first evening back in Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle&#39;s diary and told her the story of how they had found it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oooh, it might have hidden powers,&quot; said Hermione enthusiastically, taking the diary and looking at it closely.<br /> <br /> &quot;If it has, it&#39;s hiding them very well,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s shy. I don&#39;t know why you don&#39;t chuck it, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special services to Hogwarts either.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Could&#39;ve been anything,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Maybe he got thirty O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he murdered Myrtle; that would&#39;ve done everyone a favor ...&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry could tell from the arrested look on Hermione&#39;s face that she was thinking what he was thinking.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Ron, looking from one to the other.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s what Malfoy said.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah...&quot; said Ron slowly.<br /> <br /> &quot;And this diary is fifty years old,&quot; said Hermione, tapping it excitedly.<br /> <br /> &quot;So?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, Ron, wake up,&quot; snapped Hermione. &quot;We know the person who opened the Chamber last time was expelled fifty years ago. We know T. M. Riddle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catching the Heir of Slytherin? His diary would probably tell us everything - where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort of creature lives in it - the person who&#39;s behind the attacks this time wouldn&#39;t want that lying around, would they?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s a brilliant theory, Hermione,&quot; said Ron, &quot;with just one tiny little flaw. There&#39;s nothing written in his diary.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Hermione was pulling her wand out of her bag.<br /> <br /> &quot;It might be invisible ink!&quot; she whispered.<br /> <br /> She tapped the diary three times and said, &quot;Aparecium!&quot;<br /> <br /> Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back into her bag and pulled out what appeared to be a bright red eraser.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,&quot; she said.<br /> <br /> She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m telling you, there&#39;s nothing to find in there,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Riddle just got a diary for Christmas and couldn&#39;t be bothered filling it in.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry couldn&#39;t explain, even to himself, why he didn&#39;t just throw Riddle&#39;s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the diary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turning the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle before, it still seemed to mean something to him, almost as though Riddle was a friend he&#39;d had when he was very small, and had half-forgotten. But this was absurd. He&#39;d never had friends before Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that.<br /> <br /> Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about Riddle, so next day at break, he headed for the trophy room to examine Riddle&#39;s special award, accompanied by an interested Hermione and a thoroughly unconvinced Ron, who told them he&#39;d seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime.<br /> <br /> Riddle&#39;s burnished gold shield was tucked away in a corner cabinet. It didn&#39;t carry details of why it had been given to him (&quot;Good thing, too, or it&#39;d be even bigger and I&#39;d still be polishing it,&quot; said Ron). However, they did find Riddle&#39;s name on an old Medal for Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys.<br /> <br /> &quot;He sounds like Percy,&quot; said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. &quot;Prefect, Head Boy... probably top of every class--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You say that like it&#39;s a bad thing,&quot; said Hermione in a slightly hurt voice.<br /> <br /> The sun had now begun to shine weakly on Hogwarts again. Inside the castle, the mood had grown more hopeful. There had been no more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and Madam Pomfrey was pleased to report that the Mandrakes were becoming moody and secretive, meaning that they were fast leaving childhood.<br /> <br /> &quot;The moment their acne clears up, they&#39;ll be ready for repotting again,&quot; Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. &quot;And after that, it won&#39;t be long until we&#39;re cutting them up and stewing them. You&#39;ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.&quot;<br /> <br /> Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought Harry. It must be getting riskier and riskier to open the Chamber of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the monster, whatever it was, was even now settling itself down to hibernate for another fifty years...<br /> <br /> Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn&#39;t take this cheerful view. He was still convinced that Harry was the guilty one, that he had &quot;given himself away&quot; at the Dueling Club. Peeves wasn&#39;t helping matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing &quot;Oh, Potter, you rotter...&quot; now with a dance routine to match.<br /> <br /> Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the attacks stop. Harry overheard him telling Professor McGonagall so while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any more trouble, Minerva,&quot; he said, tapping his nose knowingly and winking. &quot;I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Rather sensible to stop now, before I came down hard on him.<br /> <br /> &quot;You know, what the school needs now is a morale-booster. Wash away the memories of last term! I won&#39;t say any more just now, but I think I know just the thing...&quot;<br /> <br /> He tapped his nose again and strode off.<br /> <br /> Lockhart&#39;s idea of a morale-booster became clear at breakfast time on February fourteenth. Harry hadn&#39;t had much sleep because of a late-running Quidditch practice the night before, and he hurried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a moment, that he&#39;d walked through the wrong doors.<br /> <br /> The walls were all covered with large, lurid pink flowers. Worse still, heart-shaped confetti was falling from the pale blue ceiling. Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting looking sickened, and Hermione seemed to have been overcome with giggles.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Harry asked them, sitting down and wiping confetti off his bacon.<br /> <br /> Ron pointed to the teachers&#39;table, apparently too disgusted to speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decorations, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a muscle going in Professor McGonagall&#39;s cheek. Snape looked as though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro.<br /> <br /> &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day!&quot; Lockhart shouted. &quot;And may I thank the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Yes, I have taken the liberty of arranging this little surprise for you all - and it doesn&#39;t end here!&quot;<br /> <br /> Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the entrance hall marched a dozen surly-looking dwarfs. Not just any dwarfs, however. Lockhart had them all wearing golden wings and carrying harps.<br /> <br /> &quot;My friendly, card-carrying cupids!&quot; beamed Lockhart. &quot;They will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! And the fun doesn&#39;t stop here! I&#39;m sure my colleagues will want to enter into the spirit of the occasion! Why not ask Professor Snape to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you&#39;re at it, Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments than any wizard I&#39;ve ever met, the sly old dog!&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was looking as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would be force-fed poison.<br /> <br /> &quot;Please, Hermione, tell me you weren&#39;t one of the forty-six, said Ron as they left the Great Hall for their first lesson. Hermione suddenly became very interested in searching her bag for her schedule and didn&#39;t answer.<br /> <br /> All day long, the dwarfs kept barging into their classes to deliver valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that afternoon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of the dwarfs caught up with Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oy, you! Arry Potter!&quot; shouted a particularly grim-looking dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry.<br /> <br /> Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of a line of first years, which happened to include Ginny Weasley, Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the crowd by kicking people&#39;s shins, and reached him before he&#39;d gone two paces.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;ve got a musical message to deliver to Arry Potter in person,&quot; he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not here,&quot; Harry hissed, trying to escape.<br /> <br /> &quot;Stay still!&quot; grunted the dwarf, grabbing hold of Harry&#39;s bag and pulling him back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me go!&quot; Harry snarled, tugging.<br /> <br /> With a loud ripping noise, his bag split in two. His books, wand, parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle smashed over everything.<br /> <br /> Harry scrambled around, trying to pick it all up before the dwarf started singing, causing something of a holdup in the corridor.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; came the cold, drawling voice of Draco Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everything feverishly into his ripped bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical valentine.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s all this commotion?&quot; said another familiar voice as Percy Weasley arrived.<br /> <br /> Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf seized him around the knees and brought him crashing to the floor.<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; he said, sitting on Harry&#39;s ankles. &quot;Here is your singing valentine:<br /> <br /> His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,<br /> <br /> His hair is as dark as a blackboard,<br /> <br /> I wish he was mine,<br /> <br /> he&#39;s really divine,<br /> <br /> The hero who conquered the Dark Lord<br /> <br /> Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth.<br /> <br /> &quot;Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to class, now,&quot; he said, shooing some of the younger students away. &quot;And you, Malfoy--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry, glancing over, saw Malfoy stoop and snatch up something. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry realized that he&#39;d got Riddle&#39;s diary.<br /> <br /> &quot;Give that back,&quot; said Harry quietly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Wonder what Potter&#39;s written in this?&quot; said Malfoy, who obviously hadn&#39;t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had Harry&#39;s own diary. A hush fell over the onlookers. Ginny was staring from the diary to Harry, looking terrified.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hand it over, Malfoy,&quot; said Percy sternly.<br /> <br /> &quot;When I&#39;ve had a look,&quot; said Malfoy, waving the diary tauntingly at Harry.<br /> <br /> Percy said, &quot;As a school prefect -&quot; but Harry had lost his temper. He pulled out his wand and shouted, &quot;Expelliarmus!&quot; and just as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shooting out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry!&quot; said Percy loudly. &quot;No magic in the corridors. I&#39;ll have to report this, you know!&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry didn&#39;t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking furious, and as Ginny passed him to enter her classroom, he yelled spitefully after her, &quot;I don&#39;t think Potter liked your valentine much!&quot;<br /> <br /> Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. Snarling, Ron pulled out his wand, too, but Harry pulled him away. Ron didn&#39;t need to spend the whole of Charms belching slugs.<br /> <br /> It wasn&#39;t until they had reached Professor Flitwick&#39;s class that Harry noticed something rather odd about Riddle&#39;s diary. All his other books were drenched in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with his wand again; large purple bubbles were blossoming out of the end, and he wasn&#39;t much interested in anything else.<br /> <br /> Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. This was partly because he didn&#39;t think he could stand Fred and George singing, &quot;His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad&quot; one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle&#39;s diary again, and knew that Ron thought he was wasting his time.<br /> <br /> Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank pages, not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it. Then he pulled a new bottle out of his bedside cabinet, dipped his quill into it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary.<br /> <br /> The ink shone brightly on the paper for a second and then, as though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry loaded up his quill a second time and wrote, &quot;My name is Harry Potter.&quot;<br /> <br /> The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank without trace. Then, at last, something happened.<br /> <br /> Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words Harry had never written.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come by my diary?&quot;<br /> <br /> These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started to scribble back.<br /> <br /> &quot;Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.&quot;<br /> <br /> He waited eagerly for Riddle&#39;s reply.<br /> <br /> &quot;Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want this diary read.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What do you mean?&quot; Harry scrawled, blotting the page in his excitement.<br /> <br /> `I mean that this diary holds memories of terrible things. Things that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s where I am now,&quot; Harry wrote quickly. &quot;I&#39;m at Hogwarts, and horrible stuff&#39;s been happening. Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?&quot;<br /> <br /> His heart was hammering. Riddle&#39;s reply came quickly, his writing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he knew.<br /> <br /> &quot;Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets. In my day, they told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students, finally killing one. I caught the person who&#39;d opened the Chamber and he was expelled. But the Headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak accident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. The monster lived on, and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry nearly upset his ink bottle in his hurry to write back.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who&#39;s behind them. Who was it last time?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I can show you, if you like, &quot;came Riddle&#39;s reply. &quot;You don&#39;t have to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry hesitated, his quill suspended over the diary. What did Riddle mean? How could he be taken inside somebody else&#39;s memory? He glanced nervously at the door to the dormitory, which was growing dark. When he looked back at the diary, he saw fresh words forming.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me show you.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two letters.<br /> <br /> OK<br /> <br /> The pages of the diary began to blow as though caught in a high wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hanging open, Harry saw that the little square for June thirteenth seemed to have turned into a miniscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, into a whirl of color and shadow.<br /> <br /> He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus.<br /> <br /> He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the sleeping portraits was Dumbledore&#39;s office - but it wasn&#39;t Dumbledore who was sitting behind the desk. A wizened, frail-looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was reading a letter by candlelight. Harry had never seen this man before.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said shakily. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to butt in--&quot;<br /> <br /> But the wizard didn&#39;t look up. He continued to read, frowning slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, &quot;Er - I&#39;ll just go, shall I?&quot;<br /> <br /> Still the wizard ignored him. He didn&#39;t seem even to have heard him. Thinking that the wizard might be deaf, Harry raised his voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sorry I disturbed you. I&#39;ll go now,&quot; he half-shouted.<br /> <br /> The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.<br /> <br /> The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door.<br /> <br /> Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix - no whirring silver contraptions. This was Hogwarts as Riddle had known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was Headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was little more than a phantom, completely invisible to the people of fifty years ago.<br /> <br /> There was a knock on the office door.<br /> <br /> &quot;Enter,&quot; said the old wizard in a feeble voice.<br /> <br /> A boy of about sixteen entered, taking off his pointed hat. A silver prefect&#39;s badge was glinting on his chest. He was much taller than Harry, but he, too, had jet-black hair.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ah, Riddle,&quot; said the Headmaster.<br /> <br /> &quot;You wanted to see me, Professor Dippet?&quot; said Riddle. He looked nervous.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sit down,&quot; said Dippet. &quot;I&#39;ve just been reading the letter you sent me.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together very tightly.<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear boy,&quot; said Dipper kindly, &quot;I cannot possibly let you stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the holidays?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Riddle at once. &quot;I&#39;d much rather stay at Hogwarts than go back to that - to that--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?&quot; said Dippet curiously.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Riddle, reddening slightly.<br /> <br /> &quot;You are Muggle-born?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Half-blood, sir,&quot; said Riddle. &quot;Muggle father, witch mother.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And are both your parents -?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the orphanage she lived just long enough to name me - Tom after my father, Marvolo after my grandfather.&quot;<br /> <br /> Dipper clucked his tongue sympathetically.<br /> <br /> &quot;The thing is, Tom,&quot; he sighed, &quot;Special arrangements might have been made for you, but in the current circumstances...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You mean all these attacks, sir?&quot; said Riddle, and Harry&#39;s heart leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything.<br /> <br /> &quot;Precisely,&quot; said the headmaster. &quot;My dear boy, you must see how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particularly in light of the recent tragedy... the death of that poor little girl... You will be safer by far at your orphanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the - er - source of all this unpleasantness...&quot;<br /> <br /> Riddle&#39;s eyes had widened.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sir - if the person was caught - if it all stopped--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Dippet with a squeak in his voice, sitting up in his chair. &quot;Riddle, do you mean you know something about these attacks?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No, sir,&quot; said Riddle quickly.<br /> <br /> But Harry was sure it was the same sort of &quot;no&quot; that he himself had given Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed.<br /> <br /> &quot;You may go, Tom...&quot;<br /> <br /> Riddle slid off his chair and slouched out of the room. Harry followed him.<br /> <br /> Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor. Riddle stopped, and so did Harry, watching him. Harry could tell that Riddle was doing some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead furrowed.<br /> <br /> Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried off, Harry gliding noiselessly behind him. They didn&#39;t see another person until they reached the entrance hall, when a tall wizard with long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the marble staircase.<br /> <br /> &quot;What are you doing, wandering around this late, Tom?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-younger Dumbledore.<br /> <br /> &quot;I had to see the headmaster, sir,&quot; said Riddle.<br /> <br /> &quot;Well, hurry off to bed,&quot; said Dumbledore, giving Riddle exactly the kind of penetrating stare Harry knew so well. &quot;Best not to roam the corridors these days. Not since...&quot;<br /> <br /> He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and strode off. Riddle watched him walk out of sight and then, moving quickly, headed straight down the stone steps to the dungeons, with Harry in hot pursuit.<br /> <br /> But to Harry&#39;s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hidden passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which Harry had Potions with Snape. The torches hadn&#39;t been lit, and when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage outside.<br /> <br /> It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he could see was the figure of Riddle at the door, staring through the crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feeling expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the present, he heard something move beyond the door.<br /> <br /> Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it was pass the dungeon where he and Riddle were hidden. Riddle, quiet as a shadow, edged through the door and followed, Harry tiptoeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn&#39;t be heard.<br /> <br /> For perhaps five minutes they followed the footsteps, until Riddle stopped suddenly, his head inclined in the direction of new noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking in a hoarse whisper.<br /> <br /> &quot;C&#39;mon... gotta get yeh outta here... C&#39;mon now... in the box...&quot;<br /> <br /> There was something familiar about that voice...<br /> <br /> Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped out behind him. He could see the dark outline of a huge boy who was crouching in front of an open door, a very large box next to it.<br /> <br /> &quot;Evening, Rubeus,&quot; said Riddle sharply.<br /> <br /> The boy slammed the door shut and stood up.<br /> <br /> &quot;What yer doin&#39;down here, Tom?&quot;<br /> <br /> Riddle stepped closer.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s all over,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to turn you in, Rubeus. They&#39;re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don&#39;t stop.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;N at d&#39;yeh--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I don&#39;t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don&#39;t make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It never killed no one!&quot; said the large boy, backing against the closed door. From behind him, Harry could hear a funny rustling and clicking.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on, Rubeus,&quot; said Riddle, moving yet closer. &quot;The dead girl&#39;s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;It wasn&#39;t him!&quot; roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage. &quot;He wouldn&#39;! He never!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Stand aside,&quot; said Riddle, drawing out his wand.<br /> <br /> His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone.<br /> <br /> A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers - Riddle raised his wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, yelling, &quot;NOOOOOO!&quot;<br /> <br /> The scene whirled, the darkness became complete; Harry felt himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle&#39;s diary lying open on his stomach.<br /> <br /> Before he had had time to regain his breath, the dormitory door opened and Ron came in.<br /> <br /> &quot;There you are,&quot; he said.<br /> <br /> Harry sat up. He was sweating and shaking.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; said Ron, looking at him with concern.<br /> <br /> &quot;It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago.&quot;</p>"

          "title": "Cornelius Fudge",
          "content": "<p> Harry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous creatures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he&#39;d christened &quot;Fluffy.&quot; And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hidden somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he&#39;d have gone to any lengths for a glimpse of it. He&#39;d probably thought it was a shame that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it deserved the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imagine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant to kill anybody.<br /> <br /> Harry half wished he hadn&#39;t found out how to work Riddle&#39;s diary. Again and again Ron and Hermione made him recount what he&#39;d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the long, circular conversations that followed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Riddle might have got the wrong person,&quot; said Hermione. &quot;Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;How many monsters d&#39;you think this place can hold?&quot; Ron asked dully.<br /> <br /> &quot;We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,&quot; said Harry miserably. &quot;And the attacks must&#39;ve stopped after Hagrid was kicked out. Otherwise, Riddle wouldn&#39;t have got his award.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron tried a different tack.<br /> <br /> &quot;Riddle does sound like Percy - who asked him to squeal on Hagrid, anyway?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But the monster had killed someone, Ron,&quot; said Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts,&quot; said Harry. &quot;I don&#39;t blame him for wanting to stay here...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn&#39;t you, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,&quot; said Harry quickly.<br /> <br /> The three of them fell silent. After a long pause, Hermione voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;d be a cheerful visit,&quot; said Ron. &quot; Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?&#39;&quot;<br /> <br /> In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to Hagrid unless there was another attack, and as more and more days went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody seemed to think that the attacker, whoever it was, had retired for good. Peeves had finally got bored of his &quot;Oh, Potter, you rotter&quot; song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry quite politely to pass a bucket of leaping toadstools in Herbology one day, and in March several of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Professor Sprout very happy.<br /> <br /> &quot;The moment they start trying to move into each other&#39;s pots, we&#39;ll know they&#39;re fully mature,&quot; she told Harry. &quot;Then we&#39;ll be able to revive those poor people in the hospital wing.&quot;<br /> <br /> The second years were given something new to think about during their Easter holidays. The time had come to choose their subjects for the third year, a matter that Hermione, at least, took very seriously.<br /> <br /> &quot;...it could affect our whole future,&quot; she told Harry and Ron as they pored over lists of new subjects, marking them with checks.<br /> <br /> &quot;I just want to give up Potions,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; said Ron gloomily. &quot;We keep all our old subjects, or I&#39;d&#39;ve ditched Defense Against the Dark Arts.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But that&#39;s very important!&quot; said Hermione, shocked.<br /> <br /> &quot;Not the way Lockhart teaches it,&quot; said Ron. &quot;I haven&#39;t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.&quot;<br /> <br /> Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to choose. Confused and worried, he sat reading the subject lists with his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arithmancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabbing his wand at the list, then picking the subjects it landed on. Hermione took nobody&#39;s advice but signed up for everything.<br /> <br /> Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn&#39;t get any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.<br /> <br /> &quot;Depends where you want to go, Harry,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s never too early to think about the future, so I&#39;d recommend Divination. People say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical community, particularly if they&#39;re thinking of working in close contact with them - look at my father, he has to deal with Muggle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your strengths, Harry.&quot;<br /> <br /> But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quidditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling that if he was lousy at them, at least he&#39;d have someone friendly to help him.<br /> <br /> Gryffindor&#39;s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. Wood was insisting on team practices every night after dinner, so that Harry barely had time for anything but Quidditch and homework. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least drier, and the evening before Saturday&#39;s match he went up to his dormitory to drop off his broomstick feeling Gryffindor&#39;s chances for the Quidditch cup had never been better.<br /> <br /> But his cheerful mood didn&#39;t last long. At the top of the stairs to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking frantic.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry - I don&#39;t know who did it - I just found--&quot;<br /> <br /> Watching Harry fearfully, Neville pushed open the door.<br /> <br /> The contents of Harry&#39;s trunk had been thrown everywhere. His cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off his four-poster and the drawer had been pulled out of his bedside cabinet, the contents strewn over the mattress.<br /> <br /> Harry walked over to the bed, open-mouthed, treading on a few loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Neville pulled the blankets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean swore loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;What happened, Harry?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;No idea,&quot; said Harry. But Ron was examining Harry&#39;s robes. All the pockets were hanging out.<br /> <br /> &quot;Someone&#39;s been looking for something,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Is there anything missing?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his trunk. It was only as he threw the last of the Lockhart books back into it that he realized what wasn&#39;t there.<br /> <br /> &quot;Riddle&#39;s diary&#39;s gone,&quot; he said in an undertone to Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron followed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy .<br /> <br /> Hermione looked aghast at the news.<br /> <br /> &quot;But - only a Gryffindor could have stolen - nobody else knows our password--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Exactly,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze.<br /> <br /> &quot;Perfect Quidditch conditions!&quot; said Wood enthusiastically at the Gryffindor table, loading the team&#39;s plates with scrambled eggs. &quot;Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, wondering if the new owner of Riddle&#39;s diary was right in front of his eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but Harry didn&#39;t like the idea. He&#39;d have to tell a teacher all about the diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled fifty years ago? He didn&#39;t want to be the one who brought it all up again.<br /> <br /> As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and collect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to Harry&#39;s growing list. He had just set foot on the marble staircase when he heard it yet again.<br /> <br /> &quot;Kill this time... let me rip... tear...&quot;<br /> <br /> He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away from him in alarm.<br /> <br /> &quot;The voice!&quot; said Harry, -looking over his shoulder. &quot;I just heard it again - didn&#39;t you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a hand to her forehead.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry - I think I&#39;ve just understood something! I&#39;ve got to go to the library!&quot;<br /> <br /> And she sprinted away, up the stairs.<br /> <br /> &quot;What does she understand?&quot; said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from.<br /> <br /> &quot;Loads more than I do,&quot; said Ron, shaking his head.<br /> <br /> &quot;But why&#39;s she got to go to the library?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Because that&#39;s what Hermione does,&quot; said Ron, shrugging. &quot;When in doubt, go to the library.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but people were now emerging from the Great Hall behind him, talking loudly, exiting through the front doors on their way to the Quidditch pitch.<br /> <br /> &quot;You&#39;d better get moving,&quot; said Ron. &quot;It&#39;s nearly eleven - the match--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry raced up to Gryffindor Tower, collected his Nimbus Two Thousand, and joined the large crowd swarming across the grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless voice, and as he pulled on his scarlet robes in the locker room, his only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the game.<br /> <br /> The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam Hooch released the balls. The Hufflepuffs, who played in canary yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion of tactics.<br /> <br /> Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGonagall came half marching, half running across the pitch, carrying an enormous purple megaphone.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s heart dropped like a stone.<br /> <br /> &quot;This match has been cancelled,&quot; Professor McGonagall called through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, looking devastated, landed and ran toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick.<br /> <br /> &quot;But, Professor!&quot; he shouted. &quot;We&#39;ve got to play - the cup - Gryffindor--&quot;<br /> <br /> Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout through her megaphone:<br /> <br /> &quot;All students are to make their way back to the House common rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further information. As quickly as you can, please!&quot;<br /> <br /> Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to her.<br /> <br /> &quot;Potter, I think you&#39;d better come with me...&quot;<br /> <br /> Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came running up to them as they set off toward the castle. To Harry&#39;s surprise, Professor McGonagall didn&#39;t object.<br /> <br /> &quot;Yes, perhaps you&#39;d better come, too, Weasley...&quot;<br /> <br /> Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up the marble staircase. But they weren&#39;t taken to anybody&#39;s office this time.<br /> <br /> &quot;This will be a bit of a shock,&quot; said Professor McGonagall in a surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. &quot;There has been another attack... another double attack.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s insides did a horrible somersault. Professor McGonagall pushed the door open and he and Ron entered. . Madam Pomfrey was bending over a fifth-year girl with long, curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they&#39;d accidentally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on the bed next to her was--<br /> <br /> &quot;Hermione!&quot; Ron groaned.<br /> <br /> Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy.<br /> <br /> &quot;They were found near the library,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor next to them...&quot;<br /> <br /> She was holding up a small, circular mirror.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione.<br /> <br /> &quot;I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,&quot; said Professor McGonagall heavily. &quot;I need to address the students in any case.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;All students will return to their House common rooms by six o&#39;clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No student is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a teacher. All further Quidditch training and matches are to be postponed. There will be no more evening activities.&quot;<br /> <br /> The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked voice, &quot;I need hardly add that I have rarely been so distressed. It is likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might know anything about them to come forward.&quot;<br /> <br /> She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and the Gryffindors began talking immediately.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff, &quot; said the Weasley twins&#39;friend Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. &quot;Haven&#39;t any of the teachers noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn&#39;t it obvious all this stuff&#39;s coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of Slytherin - why don&#39;t they just chuck all the Slytherins out?&quot; he roared, to nods and scattered applause.<br /> <br /> Percy Weasley was sitting in a chair behind Lee, but for once he didn&#39;t seem keen to make his views heard. He was looking pale and stunned.<br /> <br /> &quot;Percy&#39;s in shock,&quot; George told Harry quietly. &quot;That Ravenclaw girl - Penelope Clearwater - she&#39;s a prefect. I don&#39;t think he thought the monster would dare attack a prefect.&quot;<br /> <br /> But Harry was only half-listening. He didn&#39;t seem to be able to get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as though carved out of stone. And if the culprit wasn&#39;t caught soon, he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly how he had felt.<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;re we going to do?&quot; said Ron quietly in Harry&#39;s ear. &quot;D&#39;you think they suspect Hagrid?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve got to go and talk to him,&quot; said Harry, making up his mind. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s him this time, but if he set the monster loose last time he&#39;ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that&#39;s a start.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But McGonagall said we&#39;ve got to stay in our tower unless we&#39;re in class--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I think,&quot; said Harry, more quietly still, &quot;it&#39;s time to get my dad&#39;s old cloak out again.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and silvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid without anyone knowing about it. They went to bed at the usual time, waited until Neville, Dean, and Seamus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over themselves.<br /> <br /> The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors wasn&#39;t enjoyable. Harry, who had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn&#39;t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors and eased them open.<br /> <br /> It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid&#39;s house and pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.<br /> <br /> Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. &quot;What&#39;re you two doin&#39;here?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;s that for?&quot; said Harry, pointing at the crossbow as they stepped inside.<br /> <br /> &quot;Nothin&#39;- nothin&#39;-&quot; Hagrid muttered. &quot;I&#39;ve bin expectin&#39;- doesn&#39;matter - Sit down - I&#39;ll make tea--&quot;<br /> <br /> He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extinguished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then smashed the teapot with a nervous jerk of his massive hand.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you okay, Hagrid?&quot; said Harry. &quot;Did you hear about Hermione?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, I heard, all righ&#39;,&quot; said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.<br /> <br /> He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) and was just putting a slab of fruitcake on a plate when there was a loud knock on the door.<br /> <br /> Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panicstricken looks, then threw the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves and retreated into a corner. Hagrid checked that they were hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good evening, Hagrid.&quot;<br /> <br /> It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was followed by a second, very odd-looking man.<br /> <br /> The stranger had rumpled gray hair and an anxious expression, and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a scarlet tie, a long black cloak, and pointed purple boots. Under his arm he carried a lime-green bowler.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s Dad&#39;s boss!&quot; Ron breathed. &quot;Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up.<br /> <br /> Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty. He dropped into one of his chairs and looked from Dumbledore to Cornelius Fudge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Bad business, Hagrid,&quot; said Fudge in rather clipped tones. &quot;Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. Things&#39;ve gone far enough. Ministry&#39;s got to act.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I never,&quot; said Hagrid, looking imploringly at Dumbledore. &quot;You know I never, Professor Dumbledore, sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence,&quot; said Dumbledore, frowning at Fudge.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look, Albus,&quot; said Fudge, uncomfortably. &quot;Hagrid&#39;s record&#39;s against him. Ministry&#39;s got to do something - the school governors have been in touch--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not help in the slightest,&quot; said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of a fire Harry had never seen before.<br /> <br /> &quot;Look at it from my point of view,&quot; said Fudge, fidgeting with his bowler. &quot;I&#39;m under a lot of pressure. Got to be seen to be doing something. If it turns out it wasn&#39;t Hagrid, he&#39;ll be back and no more said. But I&#39;ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn&#39;t be doing my duty--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Take me?&quot; said Hagrid, who was trembling. &quot;Take me where?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;For a short stretch only,&quot; said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid&#39;s eyes. &quot;Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you&#39;ll be let out with a full apology--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Not Azkaban?&quot; croaked Hagrid.<br /> <br /> Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the door.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore answered it. It was Harry&#39;s turn for an elbow in the ribs; he&#39;d let out an audible gasp.<br /> <br /> Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Hagrid&#39;s hut, swathed in a long black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang started to growl.<br /> <br /> &quot;Already here, Fudge,&quot; he said approvingly. &quot;Good, good...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What&#39;re you doin&#39;here?&quot; said Hagrid furiously. &quot;Get outta my house!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in being inside your - er - d&#39;you call this a house?&quot; said Lucius Malfoy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. &quot;I simply called at the school and was told that the headmaster was here.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And what exactly did you want with me, Lucius?&quot; said Dumbledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue eyes.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,&quot; said Malfoy lazily, taking out a long roll of parchment, &quot;but the governors feel it&#39;s time for you to step aside. This is an Order of Suspension - you&#39;ll find all twelve signatures on it. I&#39;m afraid we feel you&#39;re losing your touch. How many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, wasn&#39;t it? At this rate, there&#39;ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, now, see here, Lucius,&quot; said Fudge, looking alarmed, &quot;Dumbledore suspended - no, no - last thing we want just now.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors, Fudge,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. &quot;And as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can&#39;t stop them,&quot; said Fudge, whose upper lip was sweating now, &quot;I mean to say, who can?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. &quot;But as all twelve of us have voted--&quot;<br /> <br /> Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceiling.<br /> <br /> An&#39;how many did yeh have ter threaten an&#39;blackmail before they agreed, Malfoy, eh?&quot; he roared.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into trouble one of these days, Hagrid,&quot; said Mr. Malfoy. &quot;I would advise you not to shout at the Azkaban guards like that. They won&#39;t like it at all.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeh can&#39;take Dumbledore!&quot; yelled Hagrid, making Fang the boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. &quot;Take him away, an&#39;the Muggle-borns won&#39;stand a chance! There&#39;ll be killin&#39;next!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Calm yourself, Hagrid,&quot; said Dumbledore sharply. He looked at Lucius Malfoy.<br /> <br /> &quot;If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step aside--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But -&quot; stuttered Fudge.<br /> <br /> &quot;No!&quot; growled Hagrid.<br /> <br /> Dumbledore had not taken his bright blue eyes off Lucius Malfoy&#39;s cold gray ones.<br /> <br /> &quot;However,&quot; said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly so that none of them could miss a word, &quot;you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.&quot;<br /> <br /> For a second, Harry was almost sure Dumbledore&#39;s eyes flickered toward the corner where he and Ron were hidden.<br /> <br /> &quot;Admirable sentiments,&quot; said Malfoy, bowing. &quot;We shall all miss your - er - highly individual way of running things, Albus, and only hope your successor willl manage to prevent any - ah - killins.&quot;<br /> <br /> He strode to the cabin door, opened it, and bowed Dumbledore out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead of him, but Hagrid stood his ground, took a deep breath, and said carefully, &quot;If anyone wanted ter find out some stuff, all they&#39;d have ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That&#39;d lead em right. That&#39;s all I&#39;m sayin&#39;.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fudge stared at him in amazement.<br /> <br /> &quot;All right, I&#39;m comin&#39;, said Hagrid, pulling on his moleskin overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he stopped again and said loudly, &quot;An&#39;someone&#39;ll need ter feed Fang while I&#39;m away.&quot;<br /> <br /> The door banged shut and Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re in trouble now,&quot; Ron said hoarsely. &quot;No Dumbledore. They might as well close the school tonight. There&#39;ll be an attack a day with him gone.&quot;<br /> <br /> Fang started howling, scratching at the closed door.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;</p>"

          "title": "Aragog",
          "content": "<p> Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn&#39;t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron had tried to visit Hermione, but visitors were now barred from the hospital wing.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re taking no more chances,&quot; Madam Pomfrey told them severely through a crack in the infirmary door. &quot;No, I&#39;m sorry, there&#39;s every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off...&quot;<br /> <br /> With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn&#39;t look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.<br /> <br /> Harry constantly repeated Dumbledore&#39;s final words to himself &quot;I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.&quot; But what good were these words? Who exactly were they supposed to ask for help, when everyone was just as confused and scared as they were?<br /> <br /> Hagrid&#39;s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand. The trouble was, there didn&#39;t seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren&#39;t allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.<br /> <br /> One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn&#39;t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.<br /> <br /> &quot;I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore,&quot; he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. &quot;I told you he thinks Dumbledore&#39;s the worst headmaster the school&#39;s ever had. Maybe we&#39;ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who won&#39;t want the Chamber of Secrets closed. McGonagall won&#39;t last long, she&#39;s only filling in...&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione&#39;s empty seat and cauldron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Sir,&quot; said Malfoy loudly. &quot;Sir, why don&#39;t you apply for the headmaster&#39;s job?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Now, now, Malfoy,&quot; said Snape, though he couldn&#39;t suppress a thin-lipped smile. &quot;Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he&#39;ll be back with us soon enough.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; said Malfoy, smirking. &quot;I expect you&#39;d have Father&#39;s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job - I&#39;ll tell Father you&#39;re the best teacher here, sir--&quot;<br /> <br /> Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into his cauldron.<br /> <br /> &quot;I&#39;m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven&#39;t all packed their bags by now,&quot; Malfoy went on. &quot;Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. Pity it wasn&#39;t Granger--&quot;<br /> <br /> The bell rang at that moment, which was lucky; at Malfoy&#39;s last words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed.<br /> <br /> &quot;Let me at him,&quot; Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his arms. &quot;I don&#39;t care, I don&#39;t need my wand, I&#39;m going to kill him with my bare hands--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hurry up, I&#39;ve got to take you all to Herbology,&quot; barked Snape over the class&#39;s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loose. It was only safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses.<br /> <br /> The Herbology class was very subdued; there were now two missing from their number, Justin and Hermione.<br /> <br /> Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an armful of withered stalks onto the compost heap and found himself face-to-face with Ernie Macmillan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, &quot;I just want to say, Harry, that I&#39;m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you&#39;d never attack Hermione Granger, and I apologize for all the stuff I said. We&#39;re all in the same boat now, and, well--&quot;<br /> <br /> He held out a pudgy hand, and Harry shook it.<br /> <br /> Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig as Harry and Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;That Draco Malfoy character,&quot; said Ernie, breaking off dead twigs, &quot;he seems very pleased about all this, doesn&#39;t he? D&#39;you know, I think he might be Slytherin&#39;s heir.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s clever of you,&quot; said Ron, who didn&#39;t seem to have forgiven Ernie as readily as Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Do you think it&#39;s Malfoy, Harry?&quot; Ernie asked.<br /> <br /> &quot;No,&quot; said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared.<br /> <br /> A second later, Harry spotted something.<br /> <br /> Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other side of the glass, moving in an unnaturally straight line as though taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ouch! What&#39;re you--&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry pointed out the spiders, following their progress with his eyes screwed up against the sun.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; said Ron, trying, and failing, to look pleased. &quot;But we can&#39;t follow them now--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously.<br /> <br /> Harry&#39;s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pursued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they would end up.<br /> <br /> &quot;Looks like they&#39;re heading for the Forbidden Forest...&quot;<br /> <br /> And Ron looked even unhappier about that.<br /> <br /> At the end of the lesson Professor Sprout escorted the class to their Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged behind the others so they could talk out of earshot.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll have to use the Invisibility Cloak again,&quot; Harry told Ron. &quot;We can take Fang with us. He&#39;s used to going into the forest with Hagrid, he might be some help.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Right,&quot; said Ron, who was twirling his wand nervously in his fingers. &quot;Er - aren&#39;t there - aren&#39;t there supposed to be werewolves in the forest?&quot; he added as they took their usual places at the back of Lockhart&#39;s classroom.<br /> <br /> Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, &quot;There are good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the unicorns...&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron had never been into the Forbidden Forest before. Harry had entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again.<br /> <br /> Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant.<br /> <br /> &quot;Come now,&quot; he cried, beaming around him. &quot;Why all these long faces?&quot;<br /> <br /> People swapped exasperated looks, but nobody answered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Don&#39;t you people realize,&quot; said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as though they were all a bit dim, &quot;the danger has passed! The culprit has been taken away--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Says who?&quot; said Dean Thomas loudly.<br /> <br /> &quot;My dear young man, the Minister of Magic wouldn&#39;t have taken Hagrid if he hadn&#39;t been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty,&quot; said Lockhart, in the tone of someone explaining that one and one made two.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, yes he would,&quot; said Ron, even more loudly than Dean.<br /> <br /> &quot;I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid&#39;s arrest than you do, Mr. Weasley,&quot; said Lockhart in a self-satisfied tone.<br /> <br /> Ron started to say that he didn&#39;t think so, somehow, but stopped in midsentence when Harry kicked him hard under the desk.<br /> <br /> &quot;We weren&#39;t there, remember?&quot; Harry muttered.<br /> <br /> But Lockhart&#39;s disgusting cheeriness, his hints that he had always thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart&#39;s stupid face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: Let&#39;s do it tonight.<br /> <br /> Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to stiffen his resolve, and he nodded.<br /> <br /> The Gryffindor common room was always very crowded these days, because from six o&#39;clock onward the Gryffindors had nowhere else to go. They also had plenty to talk about, with the result that the common room often didn&#39;t empty until past midnight.<br /> <br /> Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right after dinner, and spent the evening sitting on it, waiting for the room to clear. Fred and George challenged Harry and Ron to a few games of Exploding Snap, and Ginny sat watching them, very subdued in Hermione&#39;s usual chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on purpose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed.<br /> <br /> Harry and Ron waited for the distant sounds of two dormitory doors closing before seizing the cloak, throwing it over themselves, and climbing through the portrait hole.<br /> <br /> It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all the teachers. At last they reached the entrance hall, slid back the lock on the oak front doors, squeezed between them, trying to stop any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds.<br /> <br /> &quot;Course,&quot; said Ron abruptly as they strode across the black grass, &quot;we might get to the forest and find there&#39;s nothing to follow. Those spiders might not&#39;ve been going there at all. I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but...&quot;<br /> <br /> His voice trailed away hopefully.<br /> <br /> They reached Hagrid&#39;s house, sad and sorry-looking with its blank windows. When Harry pushed the door open, Fang went mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued his teeth together.<br /> <br /> Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid&#39;s table. There would be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest.<br /> <br /> &quot;C&#39;mon, Fang, we&#39;re going for a walk,&quot; said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.<br /> <br /> Harry took out his wand, murmured, &quot;Lumos!&quot; and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.<br /> <br /> &quot;Good thinking,&quot; said Ron. &quot;I&#39;d light mine, too, but you know - it&#39;d probably blow up or something...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.<br /> <br /> &quot;Okay,&quot; Ron sighed as though resigned to the worst, &quot;I&#39;m ready. Let&#39;s go.&quot;<br /> <br /> So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry&#39;s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry&#39;s wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.<br /> <br /> Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he&#39;d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.<br /> <br /> Something wet touched Harry&#39;s hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron&#39;s foot, but it was only Fang&#39;s nose.<br /> <br /> &quot;What d&#39;you reckon?&quot; Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could just make out, reflecting the light from his wand.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve come this far,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn&#39;t move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang&#39;s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.<br /> <br /> They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.<br /> <br /> Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins.<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot; said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry&#39;s elbow very hard.<br /> <br /> &quot;There&#39;s something moving over there,&quot; Harry breathed. &quot;Listen... sounds like something big...&quot;<br /> <br /> They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as it carved a path through the trees.<br /> <br /> &quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Ron. &quot;Oh, no, oh, no, oh--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Shut up,&quot; said Harry frantically. &quot;It&#39;ll hear you.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Hear me?&quot; said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. &quot;It&#39;s already heard Fang!&quot;<br /> <br /> The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting. There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.<br /> <br /> &quot;What d&#39;you think it&#39;s doing?&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Probably getting ready to pounce,&quot; said Ron.<br /> <br /> They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.<br /> <br /> &quot;D&#39;you think it&#39;s gone?&quot; Harry whispered.<br /> <br /> &quot;Dunno--&quot;<br /> <br /> Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.<br /> <br /> &quot;Harry!&quot; Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief &quot;Harry, it&#39;s our car!&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Come on!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing.<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley&#39;s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.<br /> <br /> &quot;It&#39;s been here all the time!&quot; said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. &quot;Look at it. The forest&#39;s turned it wild...&quot;<br /> <br /> The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn&#39;t seem at all keen on it; he kept close to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed his wand back into his robes.<br /> <br /> &quot;And we thought it was going to attack us!&quot; said Ron, leaning against the car and patting it. &quot;I wondered where it had gone!&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ve lost the trail,&quot; he said. &quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go and find them.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron didn&#39;t speak. He didn&#39;t move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more clicking, and saw Ron&#39;s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling - next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.<br /> <br /> Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn&#39;t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.<br /> <br /> He never knew how long he was in the creature&#39;s clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.<br /> <br /> Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.<br /> <br /> Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn&#39;t howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream and his eyes were popping.<br /> <br /> Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.<br /> <br /> &quot;Aragog!&quot; it called. &quot;Aragog!&quot;<br /> <br /> And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.<br /> <br /> &quot;What is it?&quot; he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Men,&quot; clicked the spider who had caught Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Is it Hagrid?&quot; said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.<br /> <br /> &quot;Strangers,&quot; clicked the spider who had brought Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;Kill them,&quot; clicked Aragog fretfully. &quot;I was sleeping...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;re friends of Hagrid&#39;s,&quot; Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to pound in his throat.<br /> <br /> Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.<br /> <br /> Aragog paused.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,&quot; he said slowly.<br /> <br /> &quot;Hagrid&#39;s in trouble,&quot; said Harry, breathing very fast. &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;ve come.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;In trouble?&quot; said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the clicking pincers. &quot;But why has he sent you?&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn&#39;t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.<br /> <br /> &quot;They think, up at the school, that Hagrid&#39;s been setting a - a - something on students. They&#39;ve taken him to Azkaban.&quot;<br /> <br /> Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn&#39;t usually make Harry feel sick with fear.<br /> <br /> &quot;But that was years ago,&quot; said Aragog fretfully. &quot;Years and years ago. I remember it well. That&#39;s why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened the Chamber and set me free.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;And you... you didn&#39;t come from the Chamber of Secrets?&quot; said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead.<br /> <br /> &quot;I!&quot; said Aragog, clicking angrily. &quot;I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid&#39;s goodness...&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry summoned what remained of his courage.<br /> <br /> &quot;So you never - never attacked anyone?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;Never,&quot; croaked the old spider. &quot;It would have been my instinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discovered in a bathroom. I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But then... Do you know what did kill that girl?&quot; said Harry. &quot;Because whatever it is, it&#39;s back and attacking people again--&quot;<br /> <br /> His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the rustling of many long legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.<br /> <br /> &quot;The thing that lives in the castle,&quot; said Aragog, &quot;is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others. Well do I remember how I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast moving about the school.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;What is it?&quot; said Harry urgently.<br /> <br /> More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.<br /> <br /> &quot;We do not speak of it!&quot; said Aragog fiercely. &quot;We do not name it! I never even told Hagrid the name of that dread creature, though he asked me, many times.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry didn&#39;t want to press the subject, not with the spiders pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron.<br /> <br /> &quot;We&#39;ll just go, then,&quot; Harry called desperately to Aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind him.<br /> <br /> &quot;Go?&quot; said Aragog slowly. &quot;I think not...&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;But - but--&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat, when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.&quot;<br /> <br /> Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid wall of spiders, clicking, their many eyes gleaming in their ugly black heads.<br /> <br /> Even as he reached for his wand, Harry knew it was no good, there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die fighting, a loud, long note sounded, and a blaze of light flamed through the hollow.<br /> <br /> Mr. Weasley&#39;s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the doors flew open.<br /> <br /> &quot;Get Fang!&quot; Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car - the doors slammed shut - Ron didn&#39;t touch the accelerator but the car didn&#39;t need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.<br /> <br /> Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes weren&#39;t popping anymore.<br /> <br /> &quot;Are you okay?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.<br /> <br /> They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.<br /> <br /> The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid&#39;s house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.<br /> <br /> Harry went back into Hagrid&#39;s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent sick in the pumpkin patch.<br /> <br /> &quot;Follow the spiders,&quot; said Ron weakly, wiping his mouth on his sleeve. &quot;I&#39;ll never forgive Hagrid. We&#39;re lucky to be alive.&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;I bet he thought Aragog wouldn&#39;t hurt friends of his,&quot; said Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;That&#39;s exactly Hagrid&#39;s problem!&quot; said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. &quot;He always thinks monsters aren&#39;t as bad as they&#39;re made out, and look where it&#39;s got him! A cell in Azkaban!&quot; He was shivering uncontrollably now. &quot;What was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out, I&#39;d like to know?&quot;<br /> <br /> &quot;That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; said Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. &quot;He was innocent.&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn&#39;t his idea of being innocent.<br /> <br /> As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.<br /> <br /> Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, however, didn&#39;t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his fourposter, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said.<br /> <br /> The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort -even other monsters didn&#39;t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to finding out what it was, or how it petrified its victims. Even Hagrid had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets.<br /> <br /> Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window.<br /> <br /> He couldn&#39;t see what else they could do. They had hit dead ends everywhere. Riddle had caught the wrong person, the Heir of Slytherin had got off, and no one could tell whether it was the same person, or a different one, who had opened the Chamber this time. There was nobody else to ask. Harry lay down, still thinking about what Aragog had said.<br /> <br /> He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron,&quot; he hissed through the dark, &quot;Ron--&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron woke with a yelp like Fang&#39;s, stared wildly around, and saw Harry.<br /> <br /> &quot;Ron - that girl who died. Aragog said she was found in a bathroom,&quot; said Harry, ignoring Neville&#39;s snuffling snores from the corner. &quot;What if she never left the bathroom? What if she&#39;s still there?&quot;<br /> <br /> Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And then he understood, too.<br /> <br /> &quot;You don&#39;t think - not Moaning Myrtle?&quot;</p>"
